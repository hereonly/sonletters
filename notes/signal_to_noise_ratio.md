Signal-to-Noise Ratio

This is the idea that when you're consuming some sort of media there's a mix of useful information (the signal) and useless chatter (the background noise). 

The [signal-to-noise ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio) is a way to talk about how easy it is to get the parts you want from any given stream of data. If the ratio is high it means there's more signal than noise and you don't have to work as hard to hear what's being transmitted. 

I'm using the phrase colloquially to express the idea that you're "picking up what someone is laying down." 

My hope is that these letters have a high signal-to-noise ratio. My daily journal has a very low ratio, it's mostly noise. Every once in a while some signal will come through and when it does I try to move it to a different place where I keep high signal writing.
