We were in Colorado for Thanksgiving. There was a six hour delay on our flight from LaGuardia to Denver. We waited it out in the food court and Leoâ€”you and I went up and down the escalators for, I'm not joking, two hours. Mama bought some [toy FDNY fire trucks](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqTInzaAXPipi7ljoton3u51CaN2IA-TicSYyE0/) and they kept you more occupied than the "airplane iPad" that I brought.

There was good food, [hikes with Uncle Robert](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqiLpkUAkZD_sFBOsgrLdyUunAtuyl3ZBE72Rg0/), and [plenty of naps](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqiL9WvAdhPPuj8A9MiWSrNgmql7hXbTFkhtZw0/). 

While we were there:   
  
Leo got the dad/grandpa thing. You looked at Scott and said, "Grandpa." You looked at me and said, "Dada." You looked back at Scott and said, "Robert's dad." It blew me away. We've been working on that concept using Papa and Mimi as examples, but it just wasn't clicking. I got really excited when you told us about the connection. It's one of the few times I've broken my [growth mindset](notes/growth_mindset.md) rule and told you you're smart. I was just so proud of you for putting it together. Sure, it sounds obvious to an adult but it's a really big concept: it's the first hint that we play roles in society (parent, child, etc.) and that while "Dada" is part of my identity, it's also an identity that other people can put on and wear. It's the first step towards understanding that my identity is more than just that of a Dad, and that we all have different roles we play in life. There's a lot wound up in here, and making the connection that Scott was both your grandpa and Robert's dad is a huge leap. 

We've also been joking about learning how to work a room. When we were playing a "your life story in 3 min" game on Monday you saw everyone else talking and wanted to join in. I told you to wait and that you'd get a turn. You waited for Lauren to stop and then you got your turn. You did a sixty second speech. We prompted with questions, and you spoke in a way that everyone at the table could hear you. You were combining sentences into a story. I joked that you needed to learn to work a room, or take the temperature of the room or something like that. Because you were kinda already doing it. You knew when everyone was paying attention to you and you got the joke that the thing to do was tell a long story when it was your turn to talk. 

Then driving back from the swimming pool, we were talking about the highway and Ellen said "That's a really complex word for a two-and-a-half year-old to know." You responded by saying it over and over again. I joked that you were showing off, and then you pointed out that there were two highways one going each direction and we laughed and said "Ok, now, he's really showing off." And you are, I think. You're able to tell what gets a reaction from us and you're enjoying the attention you get from being publicly smart and articulate. I'm encouraging it. 

The last night we were there, I promised you that I'd teach you how to read a book by yourself. We were hugging and talking before bed and you said you wanted to "read it myself." I love hearing that. Continue reading to your kids. Make it a highlight of the day and eventually they'll want to read. _Want._ That's the key. I'm not going to need to "teach you to read" as a skill for a checklist I'm going to get to do it because you want to yourself stories. 

Henry, you're 7 weeks old as of yesterday. We think we saw the first real smiles and "coo's" from you this past week. You're making strong eye contact and it's really starting to feel like you're listening to what we're saying. Immitating the conversation patterns. Mama was holding you while I hung some shelves in your room last night. I was explaining how to use a post-it note to catch the debris from drilling a hole in the wall and you were locked onto what I was saying. Then I stopped talking and you chirped back at us. It's just the first hints that you're understanding _something_ is happening when we make sounds to each other. It's thrilling to watch, because I know in a year or two you're going to be chattering with joyful abandon like your brother. 

Your mother and I have taken to refering to you two (and ourselves) as "Chatterbox 1" and "Chatterbox 2." I think technically Mom is Chatterbox 1, Leo is Chatterbox 2, Henry is Chatterbox 3 and I'm Chatterbox 4. But it shifts. Any number will do. It's based on who's chattering away the most at any given time. 

I wonder how you teach someone to listen? With empathy. With strategic consideration. For long periods of time as the other person reveals their thinking and their desires. 

Ok. Time to get you all up and start the day. 

I love you.
