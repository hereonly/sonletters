Notes from this week: 

> Leo got the dad/grandpa thing. He looked at Scott and said, "Grandpa." He looked at me and said, "Dada." He looked back at Scott and said, "Robert's dad." It blew me away. We've been working on that concept with me and Papa and Mimi and it just wasn't clicking. I got really excited and it was one of the times I told him he was a smart kid. 

> We've also been joking about learning how to work a room. When we were playing a "your life story in 3 min" game on Monday he saw everyone else talking and wanted to join in. I told him to wait and he'd get a turn. After that person stopped talking he got his turn and did a sixty second speech. We prompted with questions, but he spoke in a way that everyone at the table could hear him and was combining sentences into a story. I joked that he needed to learn to work a room, or take the temperature of the room or something like that. 

> Then driving back from the swimming pool, we were talking about the highway and Ellen said "That's a really complex word for a two-and-a-half year-old to know." Leo responded by saying it over and over again. I joked about learning to work a room again, and then he pointed out that there were two highways one going each direction and we laughed and said "Ok, now, he's showing off." And he is, I think. Or at least he's enjoying the attention that he gets from being publicly smart and articulate. I'm encouraging it.
