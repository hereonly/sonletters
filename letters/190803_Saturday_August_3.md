Happy vacation! 

We're in August and we're kicking it off with a bang. A beach day double-header. Yesterday we went to Rye Beach in the morning and then after a driving nap to see City Island we went to Orchard Beach in the afternoon. 

Leo you love the water. We talked about why the water in the ocean tastes salty and the water in the pool doesn't. I had to look it up just now. The ocean is salty because of the rocks around it. When rain falls it's slightly acidic because of the dissolved carbon dioxide that gets mixed in. That erodes the rocks around the ocean and breaks down the rock creating ions of sodium and chloride in the process. The sodium and chloride ions  taste salty.

The lifeguards don't allow floaties at the Orchard beach. You're (were) allowed to go down to the water to rinse off your hand or fill up your bucket with water. One of the times you started in up to your knees. I yelled your name, but you kept going and then you got hit by a little wave and slipped. I lept up from the towel, tunnel vision on you with your mama's voice saying "go, go, go, go, go, go" next to me, and sprinted to scoop you up. As I held you I could feel your little heart beating so fast. You spit out a big mouthful of water. We were all scared. We talked about how the new rule is that you can't go down to the water without using your words to ask an adult to go with you.

Henry you're a speedy little sand crab. Watching you at the beach is basically a game of follow, pick up, redirect, put down again, follow, repeat. We've got some cute photos and in one of them you look like this photo my parents took of me when I was your age and we went to the beach in Florida. A little baby in a diaper with a had on crawling off toward the ocean like a tiny sea turtle. 

Ok, time to get up and get started. 

I love you.
