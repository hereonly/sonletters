Happy Father's Day! 

I'm still approaching this holiday more like a son, than a father. I think it's because you two don't really understand the holiday yet, so we're not doing much to celebrate in our house. 

Maybe that will change over the years. 

I'm of two minds about this holiday.

1. On the one hand, it's a "Hallmark Holiday" created in the early 1900's...  Sidebar: [Wikipedia's entry on Father's Day in the US: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father%27s_Day_(United_States)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father%27s_Day_(United_States) makes it's origins seem less commercial than I originally thought, clearly it's become that but the delta between original intent and how an idea takes root through cultural practice is a huge topic for another day. And it would appear that there's a religious holiday, [St. Joseph's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father%27s_Day) that's been celebrated in Europe since the Middle Ages (The Medieval Period ~ 500 A.D. to 1500 A.D.) which shouldn't come as a surprise to me (though it does) considering the patriarchal influence of Christian religion. 
2. On the other hand, I think we should take advantage of every opportunity to celebrate the things worth celebrating: love, transition from one stage of life to another, the accomplishment of an important goal, the people we care about, individual acts of kindness, the rememberance of history, and so on.

So yes, let's celebrate it. No, we don't need to buy presents. Consumerism and celbration aren't the same thing. Yes, let's give gifts if that's a [love language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Love_Languages) that resonates with you. I'm not big on gifts, but I need to practice giving them more frequently because they are one of the ways that people I care about recieve love. 

And yes, let's also try to celebrate each other every day, not just on the holidays, but yes, let's also do it on the holidays. 

Let's also create our own holidays. Our own rememberances. Our own rituals, rites of passage, and traditions. Because right now "Pizza Friday" is a joy for all four of us. Knowing there's a night each week that we don't cook, we get to eat an easy, fun meal. That we get to spend the time hanging out instead of cooking or cleaning. That's a joy. And so far we're all enjoying it. Also because pizza every night would lose it's charm. It wouldn't be special. And never having pizza would feel too strict and too rigid.

Moderation might also be the Buddhist "[middle way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path)" that I'm always trying to find my way towards. 

### A few topical updates: 

Yesterday we bought a car. It's the first one I've ever owned. Your mother bought one after college when she was living in SF and working at the landscape architecture firm (SWA) in Marin. 

It's gonna be our first family car. 

We got a 2018 RAV4 Hybrid. Yes, we still use gas these days. Wild, right? It cost $26,000 in June of 2020. No idea what that price is going to look like in the future. In today's day and age it's a fairly inexpensive car in the grand scheme of things.

> The valuation analysts at Kelley Blue Book today reported the estimated average transaction price for a light vehicle in the United States was $37,851 in January 2020

We bought it used. Most everything we buy is valued in non-rational ways. Cars are a particularly egregious example: a new car loses 15% - 20% of it's value every year (for the first few years). So when it's driven off the dealership lot (yes physical places you have to go to buy a car, weird or not to you?) it can lose thousands of dollars of value within minutes. This is fascinating when thinking about pricing strategy and buying strategy, when examining the non-rational way our economy works... 

Oh! It's 6:30. I think you all are up now.

More later.
