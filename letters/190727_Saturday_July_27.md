Hi, 

I love you. I feel like I should always start with those three words. 

Leo, you gave yourself a shower two days ago. No quotes. No sarcasm. No joke. You, at three years old, gave yourself a shower. I turned on the water, put you in, close the shower curtain and then asked you if you wanted help. You said no. So I waited to see what would happen. You stood with your head under the water (which is still a big deal for baths or swimming these days). Then I said we needed soap, and asked again if you wanted help. You held your hands out and took the soap and then started rubbing it into your hair. You rinsed it off again without any help. Then you soaped up your whole body. Figuring out how to do your arm pits took you a beat. I watched you try to watch your right armpit with your right hand. It was just a handful of seconds where you tried, tried, and then switched hands. Getting to watch people learn things for the first time, getting to watch them discover how things work, experiment with the world around them—it's a joy. There are some careers where you're around people who experiment and learn new things (scientists, artists, teacher, etc.). Those are, imo, the best careers, but most people don't get the joys watching someone else learn and discover unless they're parents. So, thank you for providing so much joy for me. You're a gift. 

Henry, lest you think I'm giving you short shrift, let me say that even these letters and what I write about appreciating is part of human psychology: called desensitization. The amazing things you've done recently include: learn to crawl, learn to pull up to standing, learn to cruise (walk when holding on to something), and eat solid foods. I mean whoa! I didn't write about them first because I've watched a child discover these things before. The good and the bad is that as people experience something in life it becomes less novel and more normalized—thus less exciting (and potentially scary/dangerous). We can use desensitization to help navigate our fears of the world. It's a wonderful treatment for serious problems, but it can also have the dehumanizing effect of numbing us towards things that have been normalized which shouldn't be normalized. Becoming desensitized towards violence or hate for example. Or in this case becoming desensitized to the joy and wonder of watching a young child crawl for the first time, or eat an entire banana in one sitting. This is sorta the whole point of the joy of getting to raise children: it cracks through the years and years of desensitization that have numbed someone. It helps us see the magical in the mundane. It helps us see the world the way someone else is seeing it. It helps us see things again for the first time, to get back into the [Beginner's Mind][1]. 

So, about that banana... 

The four of us where at the "froggy" playground. Leo and Mama were playing in sprinkler, while you and I sat on the bench to watch (and stay dry). You're not yet a year old (nine months). I know you can eat bits of banana. Mama's even told me that you'll eat it straight from the banana but I haven't seen it for myself yet. You take your first smush/bite off the top. Chew it, no problem. Swallow. Bam. You're back for more. You inhaled the thing. You've got the whole process down. I'm just watching in amazement because you've only been eating solid (blended) foods for three months at this point. You went from milk, to solid foods, to damn near holding the banana yourself in just a few months. You're learning it all so fast. 

When people talk about child development, they often talk about developmental _leaps_ and really there's no better word for it. Both of you have gone from "not getting it", "not getting it", "not getting it", and then boom—you're a total pro, nearly overnight. Sometimes literally overnight. Sometimes in the span of a few days. It's so cool to watch, even if I can't always analyze what is is specifically that changed. Usually I think it's just more practice and more time (with a health dose of sleep mixed in to let the brain integrate everything it learned). 

Ok, cuteness round-up: 

[All of us taking the subway][2] to the swimming pool.

Henry:
* You've started [falling asleep][3] on the way home from school.
* You're using Leo's scooter to try out for the jr. varsity [rowing team][4].
* [Standing][5] in the crib at school is better than sleeping.
* Got a little [rug-burn/puffy eye][6] after some rough crawling practice. 
* And so much cuteness: in the [bath][7], or [giggling with mama][8], in [9 mo photos][9], or just [being yourself][10].

Leo: 
* [Leading the way home][11] on the [daily commute][12]. 
* [Collecting bugs][13] at school.
* [Pushing your little brother in the stroller][14].
* Having the [best time time ever in the sprinkler][15] at the park.
* [Straight up blaming your brother][16] for Mama losing her voice.
* [Hiding in your fort][17].
* Using your brother's new-found ability to stand to your benefit by [turning his head into a foot stool][18].
* [Focusing on your work][19].
* And [reveling in the happiness][20] of your life.

Well, that's it for this letter. 

Henry, you're already up and in the bouncer. Mama and I were just talking about how to adjust the bookshelves (tighten up the stack of books on the lower shelf) so you can play with them without wreaking havoc. 

Leo, you'll be up soon. **_GREENLIGHT!!!!!!_**

Then Mama and Henry hang at home. Dada and Leo go to a kid's birthday party, then a haircut. Leo you've said you want to get your hair cut like Dada and Sean.

And tomorrow we get to unwrap the presents we got you for the summer: goggles and puddle jumpers for the pool. We've been hitting up the River Bank State Park pool nearly every weekend. It's divine. 

Ok. Ok. Gotta go. Past-self you is calling for me. 

Love and coffee (more coffee please),
Dada
