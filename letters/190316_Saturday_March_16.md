Good morning. Two weeks ago your mom went on a retreat to Kansas City, MO with 12 other women who run businesses. She gets together with this group once a quarter in person. They help each other with business and personal problems. It's called a mastermind.

Mastermind groups, therapy, mentorships, structures in which we formalize the relationships that provide support and advice. For decades I was lucky enough to live close to and have great friend groups. Clusters of 8 or so friends who all got along with each other and ran as a pack. We'd provide support and advice to each other. It's beautiful if you can find it. Like a lot of young people we didn't have the answers (even if we thought we did). We were figuring it out together on the fly. I wish I'd had therapy then. I wish I'd had more mentors. Over the years friends also got tired of trying to support each other. We wanted to have _fun_ we didn't want to only be helping with the tough stuff. One of the nice things about a mastermind is that you're making a specific commitment to help, you know it's about more than just having fun. 

I also had friend groups that were based on us being collaborators on some project. Thank god for projects. Those were the bread and butter of my social life post-college. We'd pick some interesting problem and then start to solve it. Right after college that meant writing, directing, and producing theatre in Chicago. The writing and directing was creatively fulfilling but it was familiar since that's what I'd spent college doing. The _producing_ that was hard and new. Do we have a network of people to put the word out about auditions? Do we have a space for auditions? Do we put out ads? Where? How do we pay for that? Do we have a rehearsal space? Can everyone get to it? Does it work with our schedule? How are we paying for that? Who do we choose to be a part of the project? How do we start generating excitement about the project before it opens? How do we fundraise to help with the costs? Contracts for space rental. Copy for advertisements. Thinking about how to spend what little free time we do have feeding the community and building the network. Whose shows do I go to see on the weekend? What do I learn? Who do I support? Do they support me? Whose help can I ask for? Whose can I count on? Do I need to ask for favors to get this done? How will I know if it all works? 

Anyway, I diverge from the point: we had our first weekend where it was just the three of us. We ate pizza for dinner, breakfast, and lunch. The power of leftovers was strong. We got help from Ms. B. We hung out with Kevin, Isabelle, and Mirren. We read books, played games, and mostly stayed inside. I drank a ton of coffee and was so glad to see your mom get back. 

It will be the first of many weekends where it's just us. I want to say "Peck Boy Weekends" but I'm wondering whether in the future one of you will identify in a way that doesn't fit with the "Peck Boys" and I don't want to exclude you. But also, we can cross that bridge when we come to it. Or now. I can cross it now. I want something. A thing that helps knit us all together. I want things for the whole family that knit us together. I want things for the three of us. I want things for mom and I. I want things for just you two. I want things with me and Leo and things with me and Henry. I want to invest in our relationships and have jokes, nicknames, "clubs", and things that we share that strengthen our bonds. Building a family takes work. It doesn't just happen because you're related and sharing a house. I want us all to be close. So, I want a thing for the three of us to share and it probably should be about more than gender. 

Your mom is starting to build out her speaking career, which means more travel away from the family. So on those times that she's away I want to embrace it as "us" time instead of focusing on missing her. What's our club? Who are we, the three of us? Time will tell but for now it's the [triumvirate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumvirate) or the [troika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troika). The trio. Not the [Stooges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stooges). Maybe the [Musketeers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers), Athos, Aramis, and Porthos. Maybe (probably not) the [Caballeros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Caballeros). Definitely not the [tenors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Tenors) or the [degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Degrees). Have you heard me sing? I've tried many things, and it's good to know what you fail at despite your best efforts.

I love you. That's almost all that I'm ever trying to say.
