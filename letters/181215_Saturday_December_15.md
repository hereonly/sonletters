We're headed to Louisville for Xmas (Prospect, really, but I still think of it as Louisville). We fly out in four days.

Henry you get to meet Papa and Tia for the first time, and they get to meet you. I'm so excited to have the whole (Younger) family together for the holidays. 

Leo, you're adapting to pre-school like a champ. Your teacher did a section on families and we sent in photos of the whole family and you stood up at the front of the class with Ms. Michelle and talked about your family. When you came home that night you gave Mama and me a hug at the same time and said "I love you Mama and Dada." It was heart-meltingly cute. I love you too, buddy. 

Presents, presents, presents. Your grandparents and your aunt are about to spoil you rotten and you don't even know it. Also, we've still got a steady supply of new books hidden away from you in the closet which we'll be doling out over the coming weeks. These are from the baby registry we setup for Henry which was mostly about building out our library so there's more to read to you. Yes, I've been hiding books from you. No, I don't feel the least bit guilty about it. Yes, I love giving you new books to read every few weeks. Yes, I want to make reading books the best. 

A friend of ours, MPD, once joked that the one thing our kids could do to really hurt us and provoke us was to become book-burners. He's not wrong. Let's hope though that when the time comes for you two to rebel you find lots of other creative ways to assert your independence besides burning books. PS - If we've at that time now as you're reading it and you need more independence, just tell to me to lay off and remind me about the whole book burning thing. My parents did a good job of giving me freedom and responsibility as a teenager and it paid off. I have a much healthier relationship to responsibility and to them as a result. The time is coming sooner than I think when you two will be going through the motions of independence and then truly being independent from us. So I might as well prepare for that. 

I'm getting ahead of myself. Henry, you're still in diapers. Leo, you haven't started school yet. I've got some time.

Leo, you just learned how to use scissors. It's something new they let you do in preschool. You couldn't use them at the beginning of the week and by Thursday you were showing me how you cut paper. One of your teachers, Ms. Limei, was telling me that when you figured it out you spent the next several hours totally focused on cutting with scissors. You cut for an hour, and then they had an activity you had to go do (like "circle time") and once you had free rein again you went back to cutting. You were so focused. When you showed me on Thursday how it worked you got so intent that you actually drooled a little bit. Then as I was putting you to bed last night it was the new exciting thing you shared as part of your day. You told me that you cut paper and play-doh. Considering you've been telling me that you went swimming for the past five months (since our trip to the beach in July), it seems like learning to use scissors really made a big impression on you.

In preschool, you're allowed to go to the playground at the park  a few blocks away from school. I just got a picture of you running on the jungle gym this week from Ms. Michelle. 

The word "Yesterday" means anytime in the past. You use it to mean five minutes ago or last week or this past summer. When Mama played the Beatles song "Yesterday," you squealed with delight when you heard them say "yesterday" and made a point of telling us that they said it. 

There are times we talk about family logistics, what's happening soon, or things that we wouldn't really talk about in front of you if we thought you could understand us. When I hear you pull out a word from lyrics in the background music or when you point out something far away when we're walking I realize how much more observant you are than we give you credit for. And I think we probably shouldn't say so many things in front of you. But also, I want us to have a family where we can talk about all the stuff and not hide away the tough conversations (or the boring but important ones).

Ok. Leo, you're up and I'm gonna get you before you wake Mama and Henry. 

Until next week. xo
