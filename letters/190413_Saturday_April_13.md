Hi guys, 

It's been a month since the last letter. We got hit with [Norovirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus) (Henry, you seemed to weather it the best of all and it's debatable whether you got it or not). If we never get it again it will be too soon. It's the same thing we had two years ago on New Year's eve. It's a crawling to the bathroom, lying on the floor kind of bad. Before that we had sinus infections. We made it through the winter and then spring really knocked us out. 

So, what happened in the past month that was _fun_? 

Plenty. 

Aunt Susan came to visit with cousin Kieran. I went to Saugerties for a solo retreat. [You two](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvsCNJZnH1KMXoU7r6esXrxYjt0dxkxfiaZErc0/) continue to[ enjoy hanging out together](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvaTPloH2zDLLQTK6p32x-k8a9tk9YG4eUBu_w0/). Henry has "[the](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvjWB2nnVojkTdyfZI4fzKBEX6PAVNcFs9NFjo0/) [cutes](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvcOf1tnahp6WTL_UOYpU5n4UKj5-i7B692MhU0/)." Henry gets to [start trying solid foods](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvl0NyMnF0MdJ5IMkz8wQX6CoBbBdYhiBtE_t00/), though so far it's just passing them from one hand to another (no interest in putting them in his mouth). When we do put food (applesauce) in his mouth it gets [mixed reactions](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwKPdlxppRLKrWOt-fC7pZyZLjBpJc2RRW3q3M0/). Leo, you ask for "a minute" during the commutes to stop and rest or look or think or just generally make me wonder why we're not hiring you out as [a J. Crew model](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvl0bKnnHbv2mlerK3luQct5urqFnvRvvFU4V00/). Henry, you figured out that [the jumperoo, lets you jump](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvw8uR9HQxYJF3t4zQypqTtXvpJpIy6w2iS0EY0/). We got in [a hike with Sean](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv1hNUQnlUO3VjfirdoyXWyBvRLOPIgWo0SOcg0/). There were [moments of cuteness](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwF6S0npSwuXlDgAkNeow6ua70RuQVDzJiKNHA0/) during [the sickness](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwANugZHtCCUFNuK25E5f1Qnu51n7lCrSze6aU0/).

Spring is finally here. Rain and warm weather. Flowers bursting up at the park. The first signs of buds on the trees. Some of the bushes are getting leafy. My allergies will kick in when the trees bloom, but for now it's just a welcome bit of warmth. 

We've started planning out summer adventures. Swim lessons. Camping trip with Mimi and Papa for labor day. Visits from Susan, Kieran, and Grandma Debbie. A cabin by a lake with Mimi and Papa. A cabin in Harriman with Kevin, Isabelle, and Mirren. A beach house rental with K.I.M. and Taavo, Meredith, and Matilda for labor day. Park and city adventures during the month of August. Zoo, Natural History Museum, maybe MoMA, oh and the [Liberty Science Center](https://lsc.org/) in NJ. We've got two or three weddings to attend (some kid-friendly).

Ok, you're up. Time to start the day.

Love you.
