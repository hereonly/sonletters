Henry Oliver Peck was born on Sunday, October 7th, 2018 at 7:57am. Weighing in at 9 lbs 11 oz and measuring 21 3/4 inches. 

Henry, you were a big baby when you were born. Our friend Jeremy said _"I didn't know they made them that big"_ and he has two kids.

Your mother was a CHAMPION, Henry. A champion. 

The early signs of labor started on Wednesday. So from that point on I stayed home and worked remotely. We knew from before that it would take a few days to really start cooking, but that we were close. 

Labor started on Friday morning. The contractions were coming once or twice an hour. It was early labor. More than [Braxton Hicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braxton_Hicks_contractions) but less than active labor. 

Labor often takes a while to get going. Movies and TV will give you the impression that labor starts and then you're in a screaming race to drive as fast as possible to the hospital before the baby arrives. In my experience, it's more like 20-30 hours of waiting before the hospital even gets mentioned. 

Friday was chill. Mimi and Papa were in town to help out. Papa picked up Leo at daycare. Mimi cooked dinner. I told my work that I was officially unplugging. We'd slept well the night before even though there'd been the occasional contraction. We knew things were going slowly enough that it wasn't going to happen right away. So we mostly stayed in bed napping, watching TV (The Great British Baking Show), and made a few small trips out into the neighborhood. We went for a short walk in the woods. I got a neck trim at the barber shop. We stopped at Capital Diner to get corned beef. It was almost like vacation. We moved so slowly. We mostly just stayed in bed and relaxed. Thank goodness, because we'd need our energy for what was coming. 

Friday night / Saturday morning. Your mom woke me up and said that the contractions were staring to get painful. The doctor said that we should come in as soon as she'd had an hour of painful contractions because second children come much faster than first children. The painful contractions started around 1:30am. We called Mimi and Papa, and told them to come over, and then around 2:30 we left for the hospital.

The drive to the hospital was a straight shot down the Henry Hudson Parkway along the west side of Manhattan. You must have liked the drive because we ended up making it again half a day later. The long and the short of it was that labor would take longer than anyone expected. After staying at the hospital for six hours the doctor discharged us and we headed home. 

You mom labored at home for most of Saturday, resting as much as she could. Mimi and Papa played with Leo while your mom and I stayed in bed. By 3:30am Saturday night / Sunday morning we left for the hospital a second time. Now labor was very active with contractions coming every 4-5 minutes. We were following the 4-1-1 rule of thumb: go to the hospital when contractions are coming every 4 minutes, when they last for 1 minute, and when both of those things have been happening for 1 hour. 

At the hospital we were readmitted and then transferred to a labor and delivery room. Almost immediately after getting to the room the doctor put Mama in the bathtub. This was one of the things your mom had really wanted, to be in the water during labor. It was such a gift to have a room with a tub so she could soak and float while laboring. I think we spent about an hour in there. I was sitting on a toilet (fully dressed) slumped over an upside down trash can trying to get some rest (while staying close to make sure Mom didn't fall asleep in the tub). 

You mom made a playlist for birth and while she was in the bath we listened to [Under Pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Pressure) by Queen and Bowie. Later after we left the bathroom and she was squatting on a yoga ball and moving around the room we listened to [Peaceful Easy Feeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_Easy_Feeling) by the Eagles. When your mom was a competitive swimmer in college (20 time All-American) she'd listen to that song right before a meet. It calmed her down and got her excited at the same time. It focused her excitement and helped her channel it. She needed that because we were very close. 

Near the end of labor she decided that she wanted an epidural, but in the five minutes between signing the consent form for the anesthesiologist and the prep they needed to do to her spine to give her the meds, her water broke and it was time to push you out.

Pushing out a baby is a heroic feat. Usually this period of labor lasts for 3-4 hours. Your mom did it for you and Leo in ~25 minutes each. 

And at 7:57am on Sunday, October 7th 2018 you were born.
