Good morning boys, 

So many things to recap. Leo these days you're fascinated by the idea of death. I really hope we're not talking about it too soon or that it's too scary, but somewhere in a conversation about eating food, pooping, animals, meat, and a dash of subway train safety the subject came up. 

Currently what you believe is this: people die, and when they do they turn into trees. Some animals eat people, and if you're eaten you die. 

It got a little too scary when I answered your question truthfully that bears eat people and that bears live in the woods (where we go hiking and camping). So for a while we didn't talk about bears. I tried to assure you that your Mama and I would keep you safe from bears and keep them away from you, but you were still scared. 

These days the approach I've taken is to tell you another true thing which is easy to believe: people don't taste good, so animals don't _want_ to eat them. This makes sense to you. So when we talk about animals that eat people, I remind you that they'd prefer to eat something else, and they'd only ever eat a person if there wasn't any other food around and they were _really_ hungry. You usually compare people to whatever food we've recently introduced to you which you don't like yet. Last night it was eggplant. 

Henry, you're so close to walking. You just moved up from the infant room to the young toddlers room and everyone there (except your bestie Ben who also just moved up) is walking. Between your classmates and your brother you're ready to go. We're starting to see you try to stand up without holding on. And you're cruising with a bit more daring reaching from the couch to the chair without holding on at all times. 

You're also so frustrated at meal times and when you're being dressed. Your reactions are so intense, so strong. Our best guess is that you've got something to say and you can't say it yet. This school you're in doesn't do as much baby sign language as the last place and your Mama and I think you need more ways to communicate those strong needs and desires you're feeling. It's gotta feel so frustrating to want more food, or be done with food, or to not understand why you're being held down and forced into clothing. 

I know this period is rough. I wish I could tell you now in a way that was clear that it will get better, because it will. Once you're able to communicate your needs and desires, we'll have an easier time giving you what you want and explaining why we're doing things you don't want. It's gonna take time though, and by the time you're reading this we'll be long past that point. We're thinking about it though. We want to help you get to the other side. It's frustrating for you, now. Don't worry my son, it will get better. Life's going to be like this frequently. It's tough, but it gets better. 

*This too shall pass.*

We put an offer in on a home recently. We've been watching the housing market for a few years, thinking of moving so that my commute is shorter and the schools are better. We found a place that was dreamy. It was in our budget and it had all of the things that were most important to us: the right schools, enough space for us without being too much space, room for family and friends to stay with us, a short walk to the center of town, access to the bike trail for my commute, access to the trail for your safe walk to jr. high and high school, parking, and more. 

We tried to go see it without you all, but the babysitter fell through and it turned out to be wonderful that way. Seeing you all crawl and run around the home made it feel even more right for us. 

We didn't get it, but we'll keep looking for something like it. 

Ok, you're up now. Time to start the next part of my day. 

I love you,
Dada
