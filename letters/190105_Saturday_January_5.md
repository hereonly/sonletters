Hi gents,

It's been a few weeks since I last wrote to you. Thanks for your patience. :)

Happy New Year! Merry Christmas! 

We went to Kentucky for ten days to visit Mimi and Papa. It was so very, very peaceful. Your mom and I would go to the gym in the mornings while Mimi and Papa [watched you](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrwB_REAbINbV9bLYetx3Mjcs1s3dZqSVD-k4s0/) or played with you or [fed you cookies](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrqqTcnghlBkZfbuW9xcadrr-aimft1P1IEKXw0/). Sometimes Leo, you would come with us to exercise. There was a "KidZone" at the YMCA which we said was the gym or an indoor playground. You called it school so we started calling it school. You'd go and hang out there while we were exercising. Then we'd pick you up and either we'd go back home or we'd go swimming.

The Y had a big kid's pool. You weren't allowed to go down the slide because you hadn't passed the swim test (a good idea probably but a bummer). In the shallow end of the pool (1-3') there was a series of sprinklers, buckets that dumped water, and other fun things to explore. Your favorite was the safety ramp that let people walk down into the pool at a gentle incline. You had so much fun playing in the pool.

When we got back we found a similar indoor gym. [Jump, jump, jump.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsHAJU_g2gxv6j9gQny-xlIt78mvSE-SrU_4Ag0/)

I don't want to move to Kentucky, but the week was so peaceful. I was hardly working. Your grandparents were helping to care for you and Henry. Your mom and I got some solo time and date time. And it was so easy there: quiet, slow, peaceful, car, easy drives, keeping the carseats in the car, things close by. It made it seem like living in Kentucky close to Mimi and Papa would be a huge lift to our lives. 

When we came back to NYC (so [many](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrlkqpaAuOs4l77K4XiOfWJxhZcU4EYuMd7zWY0/) [airplanes](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrlOuZNgEzvEj-2KHuHcE4hFew5gLRFwvjXOpY0/)), it was loud, crowded, dirty, and the cab driver was a creepy weirdo who started ringing all these alarm bells in our head. Coming off the ease of Kentucky it was easy to see how Mimi and Papa (and other family members) would feel overwhelmed coming to visit us here. It was easy to see how much energy the city demands from us to do the everyday things. It prompted us to get a lot more serious about moving up north to Westchester. 

Leo, you've been "promoted" to the preschool at daycare. There are fewer kids in that class, but they're your age or older and that's a good stretch for you since more of them are verbal. Your teachers said it was frustrating for you to use your words and not have the other kids in the two's room respect or understand what you were saying. It lead to more hitting and biting and frustration. That seems to have passed for now. 

Leo, you've been testing your boundaries (and testing our patience in the process). It's totally normal for someone your age, so I get it, but boy it can be tough to be a parent to a toddler. You're learning all the things to say that get you out of bed at night after we've put you to bed. The most effective is "I need to go to the potty" because of course we want to respect that (even though you're wearing an overnight diaper). The second most effective is to say "I want to eat. I want dinner." Regardless of whether you've a) already eaten dinner or b) refused all food earlier. For a few weeks between Thanksgiving travel and Xmas travel we were just giving in and getting what you wanted because we were exhausted and mostly because it was new behavior. You rarely asked for concessions like that in the past so we were taking them really seriously. It was only after a few weeks that we realized we were being played. The tantrums lasted for about 4 days. Those are tough days. But now you either don't throw a tantrum when we say "no" or you don't ask. Yes, you're still getting dinner and getting lots of prompting to go to the bathroom, but we're being a bit more strict about not letting you out of bed after we've tucked you in. 

To help with all of this I started blaming it on the clock. In Kentucky, to curb the screaming, I started telling you at night that even if you yelled I couldn't come get you until the clock said so. We'd look at my watch and I'd say there was nothing I could do until the clock told me to get you. It made enough sense to you that the screaming subsided. When we got back to New York your mom got us a sleep light. It's an LED light with a timer attached that we can program to turn on or change colors at certain times. We've set it up to turn green when it's time for you to wake up. That's 21 minutes from now. I can hear you thumping a bit in your crib, but so far no screaming. I expect to hear "IT'S GREEN! COME GET ME!" very soon. We've also programmed it to turn red around bedtime and to start making white noise to help you sleep. I'm hoping that works as a trigger to remind me and you during book time that we're getting close to time to brush teeth and go to sleep. It's setup to run for 40 minutes and maybe when it turns off and goes dark it will cue you to sleep. Right now you're just chilling in your bed talking to yourself and singing after we put you down at night. I've said that the light turns off when you fall asleep and I'm hoping it works to persuade you that when it turns off you _should_ be asleep. Gonna let that one be a soft sale, the you don't get up until it's green is a good hard sell. Too many hard sells and we spend all of our time in a battle of wills. 

Leo, ALSO, super exciting is this new game where you want to "do the letters" on the cover of books. It started over Christmas in Kentucky. You'd ask what letters were on the cover of the book and I'd tell you. It became pretty clear that you knew a lot of them already. The A train, the C train, L, E, and O were all letters I was expecting but you either knew more than you were letting on or you picked them up fast. There are still a few that give you trouble like K, Z, V, and H, but not that many. You're really enjoying talking about how *b d p q* are all backwards and upside down. We've started using these flashcards that show objects and spell out the word. We do some cards at night before or after book time to practice more letters. You really enjoyed spelling the words backwards so that's often how we do it. You got attached to the card for _vegetables_ and asked for it every night for a week. _s e l b a t e g e v_ over and over again. When you'd flip the card upside down I'd made a gibberish nonsense sound and it made you giggle. 

While we were in Kentucky, [you got to ride a horse](https://www.instagram.com/p/Br5g8KvAGttM2jIy0wHRreaYsM2nbVvLOi1TsY0/)! A pony named Oreo technically, but still huge to you. You were captivated with the mounting block (a mobile step-stool) especially once you learned it had a flip up top that you could hide things in. Tia gave you two tours of the barn and let you go riding in the indoor arena with her on the second visit. You got to feed peppermints to her horses (we're not sure how many she has but it's more than five). You got to run with her dog, Nelly. 

You were really thrilled to see Tia and Nelly every time they came over to Mimi and Papa's house. You'd get so excited and run to see them. It was so sweet. You played fetch with Nelly in the backyard. One of our gifts to Nelly for Xmas was a set of pink tennis balls. 

Leo, you love to say ["my brother"](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsIfAltA_YfmaZd_t0BmMU83gxicOYcDGN8Tac0/) and give Henry hugs.

Henry, you're sleep trained! You handled it like a totally champ. We did it the weekend of New Year's Eve. You've been sleeping through the night since 2019. It's AMAZING. Thank you for being so willing to go on this journey with us. I know you won't remember this period, but it was a huge help that you learned to self-sooth. It's an important lesson and one of the first a little baby needs to learn. 

Henry, you're (almost) three months old and [SUPER smiley](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsHGqQ5ABeTYOsby9vhjnYKgAFhUFJltAU5A7M0/) these days. It's [cute](https://www.instagram.com/p/Br-xgwdAZQOlnBYAAT1-Q5QDM8OPtqVbRS33mc0/) on [cute](https://www.instagram.com/p/BroHNyVgt6EHQ0qIlMk1VQRzi0GjZAuYxFu4OI0/) with a dose of [cute](https://www.instagram.com/p/BriGihzgiCW65Xh27W4hJZEioyypfRv8-J5VbM0/). 

Ok, back in New York in 2019, a little bit of screaming from your room Leo and we're T-minus two minutes from green light. 

See you soon, and love you always.
