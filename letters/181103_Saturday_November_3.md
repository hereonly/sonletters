I'm headed back to work on Monday. It's been a wonderful experience to be home with you both during paternity leave. 

If you have children, be sure to spend time with them in the early days. They may never remember it, but it's part of what turns you into a father. It teaches you to be competent with the logistics of parenting. Like anything else it's not as complicated once you start getting into it as it seems. Diapers are easy. A newborn basically cries for one of five reasons: hungry, tired, needs to burp, needs a diaper change, or just wants to be held. If you work through that checklist you'll be able to care for almost any infant. Learning to be alone with the baby is important, so that you don't start to feel like you need your co-parent there. It can be tough if the mama or the other parent won't give you solo time with the kid, but if that's the case insist on getting it. You need it for your own confidence. You can take care of the kiddo. You just need to experience doing all of it to realize just how simple it can be. 

Second time around the logistics of caring for a newborn are so much easier. You've got all the stuff. You remember your bag of tricks (even if they don't all work). You're not learning it all for the first time. The harder part is learning how to do it all while caring for an older child who needs love and attention at the same time. An older child who feels vulnerable because of all the change in their life. Juggling care for both kids is the new trick. 

The second time is also easier because you've already reorganized your life around caring for a child (and if you haven't you need to because you have children). I'm not saying there isn't still time and energy spent on non-parenting things, but for the most part your life doesn't look anything like it did before you were a parent. The first kids changes everything. Your life gets reorganized. For me, there was both logistical reorganizing and a larger emotional, psychological, existential reorganizing. The second child brings +1 logistical changes, but you've already made the leap from 0 to 1 with the first child. Zero to one is an invention of something new, it's a Herculean effort. But adding one to one, is an incremental change. It's a doubling, but it's a known quantity. 

Well, it's daylight savings soon. That means a bedtime shift. You'll be waking up around 5:30am on the clock. We're working on shifting you back, but it will take a few days. That happens right around the time I go back to work. And to complicate things daycare is closed on Monday because of a repair to a water pipe on that block, so Leo is going to a different location. So Sarah will do drop-off and pick-up at a new location, further away, after daylight savings sleep shenanigans on the first day I go back to work (getting home late that night after therapy). It's gonna be a big Monday. Best get some sleep this weekend. 

On Thursday, Leo and I went on a hike in Harriman State Park with Kevin and Mirren. We hiked out to Lake Skenoto. Kevin knew this wonderful picnic spot right next to the lake. Then after the hike Mirren came over to play at our house for a few hours. It was really nice to play hooky from school and get outside while the fall colors where in the height of their transition. 

Until next week. I love you.
