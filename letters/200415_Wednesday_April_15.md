It's day 35 of our COVID-19 quarantine. 

You, your brother, mama and I are all in our 1000 sqft NYC apartment. We (mostly) haven't been outside in over a month. We made some exceptions to: overnight packages to our attorney so she can handle the co-op closing without us, one grocery run, and Mama took two forest walks. 

... but maybe more on that all later when there's more good news. 

[And now for something completely different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Now_for_Something_Completely_Different)...

Leo, last night while we were in the bathroom before going to sleep you showed me the plastic heart button that you had in your hand. You told me it was a magic heart. I asked what it did and you said it's got all of the love and magic in it. You asked if we should use the magic, and I asked what would happen if we did. You said that if we tapped it three times, everyone in the world would get books and would feel loved. Then we played an imaginary game about the person who was trying to steal the magic. We drew a heart on the wall so we could see where she stole it and used a magic hook to grab it back. 

I love that your idea of a magic heart with all the love is that it gives people books and makes them feel loved. That's the core of what I've been trying to give you and Henry. 

Another game that you love is getting cozy. You carry blankets and pillows into the living room and pile them up. You ask me and Mama to help make you cozy. You told Mama that you needed more blankets because you wanted to be as hot as the sun. 

Ok, we're going to catch up with some friends tonight (via video call). Gotta run. 

Love,
Dada
