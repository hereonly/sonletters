# Saturday, December 14, 2019

Henry, you're walking! Friday, November 15th was the turning point. You'd taken a step here and there, but that weekend it clicked and you haven't stopped since. 

The only time you crawl is when you're going up the stairs between the living room and the foyer. In these old pre-war (1945) building in the city there's a sunken living room that's two steps down from the rest of the apartment. It makes for perfect practice for a kid learning to walk because if you fall you don't hurt yourself. 

You're unstoppable by son.

You're talking too. 

You say (and sign) "all done" at the end of meals. We know what you're saying because we've been using sign language and saying the phrase over and over to you. I'm not sure anyone else could decode it yet without context, but you've made the connection between the idea and the sounds. _Major breakthrough_. You also say "up" when you're ready to be picked up or when we're picking you up. You say "Dada". You're starting to say "hello" and "bye bye" and while those words aren't clear yet you're waving _at everyone you meet_. The subway rides to school are particularly cute because you're the happiest New Yorker in the whole city and people eat it up. 

You're also captivated by lights. 

For the past month or so you've been pointing out every light around you (over and over again). You notice overhead lights, subway lights, traffic lights, street lights, lamps, turn signals on cars, Xmas lights, and you can't get enough. I say "light" each time you point at one and just to keep from going batty with the repetition I've started telling you the color of the light too. 

The "point and learn a word" game is our jam right now. You're not saying all the words yet, but you're starting to piece it all together. We talk about toys, bicycles, music, lights, animals, books, windows, lights, plants, cars, people, lights, spoons, forks, pizza, lights, yogurt, bread, lentils, chicken, lights, and well... you get the idea. 

Oh! And last night you blew me a kiss. I showed you how to do it, and you did it back to me. We said "bye bye" and "I love you" before you went to bed and you waved and then you blew me a kiss. You picked it up so quickly.

You also can't get enough of roughhousing with your brother. You two love each other so much, and when you're rolling around on the ground hug/wrestling you're both giggling nonstop. 

Leo, you're really excited for Christmas this year. We wrote [a letter to Santa](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5gJxG2Jm3ZlCU7QmOHDAvlUIRTcrTFhWSklic0/) and [mailed it](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5iKmBep3NqNlxVEKVx78tmcqTf81UOtdjCZEw0/). You were so excited, but then again you're so excited to send letters to people right now that it might have been the letter writing and mailing more than Santa. Do you know what the Scrooges at the post office did? *They returned your letter!* Because it had an insufficient address. We wrote "Santa, North Pole" and yeah, I agree with you USPS, that's an insufficient address and. it's. for. an. imaginary. person. The last thing we wanted you to do Mr. Postman was return to sender. This can't be the first time you get a letter to Santa, so you've got to have thought about what to do in these cases. What do you think is the least likely thing the people sending a letter to Santa want to have happen? Return it to the kid who sent it. Because then the kid thinks Santa 1) didn't get their letter and 2) doesn't really live at the North Pole. Shred the letter. Open them and post pictures to a social media account "owned" by Santa. Do any number of things, but don't slap an insufficient address sticker on it and return it to the kids. 

Fortunately, we intercepted the letter before you saw it. 

Also, I'm unsure how deeply you believe in Santa to begin with because I may have taken the wrong stance on "is Santa real." Last year we told you that Santa was a story and a fun game that we all play on Christmas to give each other presents. This year the idea of getting what you want for Christmas came up while we were reading _Holly and Ivy_ and you told me what you wanted for Christmas: a toy house. I told you there was a way that kids told Santa what they wanted for Christmas and explained writing a letter. You asked if Santa was "for really" and I said no he was a story that... and then the look on your face was so crestfallen that I immediately changed courses mid-sentence. "Yes, yes Santa is for really." You didn't quite believe me, but I spent the next several days lying to you as convincingly as I could. I think now you're on board, but I'm unsure since growing up in NYC and going to a multicultural daycare is different than my experience staying at home in Kentucky. You've got Jewish friends, I wonder if you have Muslim friends, you've certainly got friends who don't celebrate Christmas so who knows what you talk about with the other kids about Santa and Christmas. You learned about Superman from your peers and explained him to me almost a year ago, I'm certain you all are talking about Santa. Anyway, I think you believe and I'm doing what I can now that I see how much it matters to you to keep that belief aliveâ€”no thanks to myself or USPS.

We're headed to Louisville for Christmas this year to see Mimi, Papa, and Tia. We're getting close to buying a car and Mama mentioned to you that one year we might drive to Kentucky and that to do that we'd get up in the middle of the night and start driving while it's dark. You were captivated by this idea and keep telling us you want to get up in the middle of the night to go driving in a car. 

Ok, time to get up and start the day. 

I love you.
