w00f. What a spring! 

Norovirius for Mom, Dad, and Leo. Two or three ear infections for Leo. You burst your right ear drum several times. Lots of visits to the doctor, a pediatric ENT got called in, and your first-ever general antibiotic. Two courses of the general, and one ineffective local antibiotic which couldn't even make it into your ear through all the discharge. Henry, you weathered most of it without getting sick, but then got one of those "baby colds" in which you just leaked snot for several weeks. And then to cap it all off Mom got the flu, an ear infection, a sinus infection, and to top it off strep throat. 

So, yeah, that sucked. 

We thought we'd made it through the winter without any sickness and then Spring brought the hammer down. 

I think I avoided the worst of the sinus infections by using a nasal steroid (corticosteroids, Fluticasone/Flonase). It was also the first year I've never had terrible seasonal allergies. And, I find myself being able to smell things I've never noticed before, so I think I'm beating some long-standing allergies. As my progeny, pay heed, for you too may benefit, sayeth I. 

Ok, so, some good news: Leo, [you're 3](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxVicufJVngWQ_jHm84shvYfglKqlG2-Qmgb2w0/)! 

We [went to Kentucky](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxFZYN4J8DxeLfbRRlCkluvmKexykqrw0rT--00/) in [an airplane](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxfxJppJl3FwHo3_bO91DXKCBGMp1UOuTAbWnw0/)! to [celebrate](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxfxnupJBdKoPk8TcF-11f-4yveoXVnIUdt3w40/) with Mimi, Papa, Tia, AND Grandma and Grandpa came to visit. 
Not enough photos up on the instagram feed, but you: 
* requested chocolate cupcakes with strawberries on top (Mimi obliged) 
* got to ride a horse (bareback)
* played fetch with Nelly
* ran around the neighborhood
* wanted a shirt with a 3 on it (again Mimi obliged) 
* went to the zoo, ate ice cream, saw so many animals, rode in a little wagon with Henry, and got to take home a big stuffed elephant (thanks Mimi and Papa)
* there was lawn bowling, [velcro toss and catch](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS722US722&q=velcro+toss+and+catch&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjMz4SxmObiAhVQiOAKHYGIBtUQ7Al6BAgGEA8&biw=960&bih=766) (god knows how well that link's going to work in ten years...), and lots of other toys and books
* your favorite books during the trip were _Digger and Tom_ and _Phoebe and Digger_


Since then we've been getting back into the routine here in NY. We didn't get a spot in 3K at Bright Horizons which means your Mom and I need to get creative about how we're going to reduce our expenses. It also means that you won't be in Ms. B's class next year. We're crestfallen about the second. She takes you and Henry to school each morning, and she adores you both. It was going to be like getting the gang back together again in September. I think it also means you might not be in the same class as most of the friends you've been with for the last year or so. Well, I guess this is "welcome to how school works." 

We hung out with Seth, Helene, Margo, Brian, and Essie for a brunch/birthday party when we got back. You spent an extra couple of hours with Seth after everyone left playing in the backyard with him and Baxter, while your Mom and I took Henry to see some houses in the area. 

Then we all went to Rye Beach for the afternoon. Henry, [you ate sand](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxnqf1cpZ87qUgyHMVEh_olfbYsGR4sCFNKRkU0/). Leo, you found a little toy dinosaur, buried it in the sand, dug it up, and repeated the whole process for hours. You also made friends with Annabelle and ran into the the water and back out of it again, over and over. [You were happy as a clam](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxo95iGpy0-1us8e1c-rDAAmtWFfD9613XvQcY0/).

Now that it's getting warm outside we've got to get. out. more. often. because. you're. [bouncing. off. the. walls](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxqjSBLnZooLCaAvQ2v125IJcxykgm1BWwQQA80/). 

[Book time!](https://www.instagram.com/p/ByQZossJ6NJTe9p4UY0-pUqSxXDKtM1McWR3HU0/)

Henry, you're _almost_ crawling. You're eight months old. We can see you scooting, lifting your butt, tipping forward from sitting, so so closeâ€”but it hasn't clicked together yet. Which is fine, take your time. We need it. The edge of parenting: excited for every development vs. sad that a period is ending. 

I know I've said it's a bit of a blur right now, and that's true. It will probably be that way for some time to come. I'm glad to get another letter off the ground. The whole spring has thrown off my routine. I need to get back to therapy, to journaling, to exercise, to writing, and to these letters. Drip by drip, gotta keep showing up. 

I'll leave you with the words I say to Leo and his 20+ stuffed animals every night. Leo, you won't let me leave the room without saying it. 

_Listen everyone, you've got to stay in bed until the green light comes on. Shhh! You've got to be quiet because it's sleep time. And most important, I love you. Good night._

xo,
Dad
