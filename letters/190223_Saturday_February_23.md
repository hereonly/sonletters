Hi,

I keep getting distracted. I want to setup a script to autogenerate your ages so I can quickly add it to the top of the letters. Henry is a little over four months and Leo is 2 3/4. 

Leo, [you wrote your name](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuOIX--HOqGvpTpB7c6C3sEpzSXpP_XhuyAEc40/) yesterday. It was the first time you've done it. You wanted to write your name on your cheese snack, so mama held the ziplock bag and without any prompting you used a sharpie to write your name. I'm so proud of you. Yeah, it's a little early developmentally, so more chitter and chatter about how smart you are, but that's not a surprise to your mom or me. Mostly, I'm so thrilled that you've put in the practice to know your letters, to notice that they make up words, and to have spent enough time drawing to have the control necessary to make what you want. 

I've been wearing a lot of band-aids recently because I hurt my hands. Which means that [you want a band-aid too](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuE2lDynhvXmEG4MnI7M8JdgxCHo0W0Jx5skno0/). 

[We talked with your great-grandpa Bill](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuC6XhWHt-aFuy3RYcSXYRw8snhE8f_W1dOvSA0/). While Grandma Debbie was out visiting him in Tucson, AZ. He was an engineer for NASA and a university professor. He taught (physics?) to a generation of NASA scientists. He currently has a device on the moon.

I only met him once. Your mom and I went out to visit while we were still dating. He told us about growing up during the Great Depression. Saving his lunch money to buy chemicals from the drug store (back when you could do that) so that he'd have the pieces he needed for his chemistry set to conduct his experiments. He served in World War II and was trained as a meteorologist. He did work with a group in the Air Force predicting weather patterns for the fighter pilots. He retained that curiosity about the weather for the rest of his life, and it was a go-to subject for him when we came to visit. 

His health isn't well these days so your Grandma Debbie is doing a lot of work to care for him. It's hard to lose your parents, and I feel for her. I haven't been through it yet, and so my heartbreak still waits for me. Watching my Dad care for his mom and dad taught me a lot about it. Watching my Mom too. I met all of my grandparents, knew three of them pretty well. I'm not sure I ever got to meet any of my great-grandparents. You still have two great-grandfather's alive. You Grandpa's dad, Owen. Your Grandma Debbie's dad, Bill. I doubt you remember the call even now a few days later, so I'm glad we've got a photo. I think it was meaningful for Bill to get to meet you two. Henry, he particularly enjoyed seeing your smiley baby face up close.

Henry, you [started daycare this week](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuE2VwsHrVgJFNeehn3jBh8CGs9MsS85HGuc780/) on Tuesday. You're in the baby room while Leo is upstairs in the preschool. It's fun to have you both in the same building because I got to bring Leo down to the baby room this week during drop-off and pick-up so that he could meet your "teachers" and see where you stay.

You're a very chill baby thus far. You didn't get much sleep the first day you were there. How could you with all the excitement and other kids trying to sleep next to you. But the second day you got a solid two hour nap in. Mama's gonna keep you home some of the days just because she still wants to keep you close. She did that on Friday and took you to your first swim lesson. No photos of that sadly, because it's too hard to selfie in a pool while holding a baby. :) You took a 4+ hour nap on Friday making up for the sleep you'd missed while you were a daycare. We think we'll keep you home a few days a week for these early months to transition you into it. You're lucky that your mom's built a career that includes that kind of flexibility in it. 

[Henry, this is how you wake up.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuMglT5nk45A8TnYWVf5QWZTUO-5dYbJB_GpsM0/) It's a little weird that you'll have video record of that. I'm showing my age I guess. For my grandparents photos were a rare occasion. My parents didn't have video cameras around when they were kids, and when they were parents recording video was cumbersome and expensive. There are only a few "Home Videos" of me and Tia growing up. Now, it so easy to record your lives. 

Which leads to conversations about privacy and archival. Now that it's so easy to record the moments, which ones do you record and which ones are you present for without a phone. Where do you share them? Who has access? Will the place we're keeping these memories last for decades into the future? What's the downstream effect of having a child Google themselves and find their entire childhood is available for strangers to view? How does a kid learn to try new things, make mistakes, and explore different ways of being in the world when it feels like every action is recorded and archived for later review? How do you carve out space to experiment, learn, and grow that remains private? We're about a decade into services that promise they'll archive your digital materials for 100+ years and into services that promise they'll delete all traces of what you shared in the next 24 hours. The edges are being explored and I'm curious what you'll find when you're old enough to read these letters. I hope your mom and I can find enough ways to give you a taste of disconnect, privacy, and anonymity so you can _choose_ what you share. With AI, facial recognition, wearable tech, and the digital mapping of the physical world I can only image more of your lives will be shared and harvested for you without your choosing. Which might be a fine thing, but we don't know yet so we're curious about the long- and short-term effects. 

Ok. Off to exercise before you two wake up. 

Happy Saturday (or whatever day it is you're reading this). 

Love, 
Dad
