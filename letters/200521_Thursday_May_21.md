Well guys, we're getting closer to closing on the new home. The co-op in Westchester. 

I'll tell you more about it later, but this note is mostly a technical test because I made some changes to my writing and computer setup. 

xo,
Dad

PS - Yes, I'm a geek. I'm sure I could have just used a Google doc or paper or something simpler, but I really like building custom solutions to fit my needs. It's extra work, but I enjoy making things. So part of this for me is just about making.
