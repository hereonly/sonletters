# Saturday, September 8, 2018

It's around 5:30am, and Leo you're still sleeping. Henry, you're still in Mama. We're expecting you to make your entrance in another month or so. 

After a rainy July, and sweltering August we're getting our first little chill in September. 

Adventures of the summer: 
* **Camping at Wildwood with Kevin, Isabelle, and Mirren** (the Sattin/Jays). The neighbors were _waaaaaay_ too loud and spoiled the spot a little. We cheered when it started raining because it meant they had to unplug their concert-grade speaker from the generator. Leo, you got to play in the cars. You adored sitting in the two front seats and pushing all the buttons. That would be a theme for most of the camping trips this summer. After the loud neighbors left, new neighbors came who had kids your age and they brought bubbles. Chasing bubbles became your new favorite activity for the weekend. 
* **[Camping at the Delaware Water Gap with Mimi and Papa](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkJFtfiFWVr1DzkVJ7ESY5Zxe6kUHefzTzd7yw0/?taken-by=lovethepecks)**. Again, sitting in the car and pushing all the buttons was a big draw. You and I went down to the river and you wanted to go swimming. We didn't have our suits on so I let you strip naked and I rolled up my pants and took off my shoes. The river there is walkably shallow for half it's width, so we just wandered out towards the birds, looked at the tadpoles, and splashed in the water. Later the next day, we put our suits on and sat our in a circle of rocks letting the rapids wash over us in the summer sun. You had so much fun hanging out with Mimi and Papa, and they felt the same way. They brought you [an orange camp chair](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkJE9cQFODZH4KxpzQSmbSYQoyEmJ00msiRHaA0/?taken-by=lovethepecks) to match the red ones that we all had, and you loved being included in the circle of chairs. 
* **Camping at Macedonia state park in CT**. This was a short trip, just an overnighter because it was raining. We weren't going to go but for the whole week before, Leo, you kept [pulling the sleeping bags out from under the bed](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjDntZrFZq5dhzCk1lfrO27jaA_vN6p_IaRnEk0/?taken-by=lovethepecks) and asking to go camping. We went on a [nature hike](https://www.instagram.com/p/BllU-PVlMVpDpWLK3DI6rjBdLLz8-f_3u5O0S40/?taken-by=lovethepecks) through the woods looking at all the stones and plants. When it rained the next day we packed up and went to a little dinner in town for pancakes and eggs. It was divine.
* **Dad's birthday Weekend with Mimi + Papa**. Your mother and I went to adult summer camp with the Sandboxer's at Camp Kennybrook, and you got a whole weekend to hang out with Mimi and Papa (and thoroughly exhaust them from what we heard). They read you books, showed you photos and video (of yourself) on the iPad, and did their best to keep up with you at the park.
* **[Beach weekend at the Rockaways](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnTWUFkFN8FHXtCVcUS7qEtPZcOdE1rAY3MzkM0/?taken-by=lovethepecks) with Kevin, Isabelle, and Mirren**. We rented a condo a few blocks from the beach and made a weekend of it. Leo, you adored the ocean and [spent _hours_ running in and out of the waves](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnTWcTYFSq3zaSS0LfHlo61ActZCaa6etQb8_o0/?taken-by=lovethepecks). We warmed up to the water by standing in the surf and letting it wash over our feet while you held my hand and mama's. Then when you got more comfortable we moved further in and sat down. Now the waves were breaking and splashing up around your chest. Mama got really worried when we stood up and went further in because of how easy it can be to lose someone in the tide if they're not a strong swimmer. She's always watching out for you. We moved back in a little and then you discovered how much fun it was to run in and out of the waves. Your work for the weekend was to go to the sand and pull up big handful, run them down to the waves, and throw them in. On the second day, Taavo, Meredith, and Matilda (the Smiths) joined us at the beach. These are some of my dearest friends, even though we don't see each other often these days. I was the minister at their wedding, and I've known them both since our theatre days in Chicago—about 14 years at this point. You followed Matilda's lead scooping sand into buckets, and then returned to your work of throwing fistfuls of sand into the waves. 
* **Swim lessons and playing hooky**. For the month of August, Leo, you got to play hooky from school on Thursdays and went to the West Side YMCA at 63rd street for [swim lessons](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmi2_ISlWczT1rJZHjPiuyh1DQqSQlSrjRQSvQ0/?taken-by=lovethepecks). You were such a champ in the water. So brave about jumping in. They setup a long foam "diving board" for you to walk out onto before jumping into the water. Other kids needed to be coaxed into the pool, but you marched right out and threw yourself in. Sometimes it was a little too quick for Mama to keep up with considering she was six months pregnant with Henry. After swim lessons Mama would take you to [Central Park for a picnic](https://www.instagram.com/p/BmUB4calVj8XFjKrFlKQkk3ZcvhhgwUm2ieMN40/?taken-by=lovethepecks). You'd [eat blueberries](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm0xFHmFiisCA4ugSuN8HKirRYEJ6YE1Gy4SA00/?taken-by=lovethepecks) (your favorite food of the summer of '18) and watch the horses pull the carriages around the park. You'd [run around the park with Mama](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl_K9WhH8_EDGU7FKAd7LHj9uFHfjKG-qWWrwc0/?taken-by=lovethepecks) and [explore](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm21srWF-XkWJ99Z6N5BHO7IcEbNEEQjJBgKNo0/?taken-by=lovethepecks) before she brought you home so you could both pass out for long naps.
* **Blueberries from the fruit stand**. There's this great little fruit stand on the corner of 207th and Broadway. It's just a half block from our apartment and right by the subway entrance to the A train. They're a friendly, cash-only little spot. The kind of weird and magical business you find on the edges. They always have the best produce (seriously a cut above any of the grocery stores in the neighborhood). They've got a van they leave semi-parked on the corner which they use to haul in and out the produce and and after their first month or so in business they put a big white tent up to add shade and to lock in their spot. They've been there since the spring. I'm not sure if they have a permit or not, but they've become a regular part of our lives, because _you_ have learned that they have blueberries. Now, whenever we pass by them (getting off the train using the elevator or walking to the "froggy" park) you ask to stop and get blueberries. At $3 for two boxes of berries it's a steal—mostly because of the joy on your face when you get to eat blueberries. [This summer it seems like the only thing you've eaten is blueberries](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkprlamFPOUNPKqsE_x9aA7yis-TV-VETed-4Q0/?taken-by=lovethepecks). Sure, there's been the occasional apple or banana, the plum or the peach, or even strawberries, raspberries, or blackberries, but all of those pale in comparison to your love of blueberries this year. Last summer was the year of the peach in the park. This year it's the blueberry.
* **Soaking up summer at the playground**. For the first year and a half of your life, Leo, I preferred to take you to the wide open spaces of the park. Your mom and I would take you on "Montessori walks" where we let you lead us wherever you wanted to go at whatever pace you wanted to go, stopping (frequently) whenever you wanted to look at something. Those were joyful. I adored watching you learn to walk that way and learn to explore while walking. But this summer can best be described as the year that you really fell in love with the playground. [Climbing](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl1PDdkFoKBny_jWuU6rdG7WvKfzLEuYFZGzV00/?taken-by=lovethepecks). [Slides](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmt1CzZlot1IjEc4OvEx7dnS-wigwQ_2roNGcI0/?taken-by=lovethepecks). Sandboxes. Sprinkers. [Swings](https://www.instagram.com/p/BmFCv65lGGkIF5NHuUuHdyH0oLAFLtB87fLnX00/?taken-by=lovethepecks). Other kids. We'd got to the playground [after school](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bld4GtwFwd5eveeiL4UYK8qIuSlcOXUSD_T6xk0/?taken-by=lovethepecks) to soak up the warm [summer evenings](https://www.instagram.com/p/BmJIqwBlIX1i6YrTlmSscJErBHJYImehzLdVkM0/?taken-by=lovethepecks). We'd go twice a day on weekends. The first trip early, right after you woke up and ate and before it got to hot. The next trip after nap and before bed. Sure, your mom and I were trying to tire you out so you'd sleep well, but we were also captivated watching you develop your coordination. Learning to climb up a slide or a [ladder](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnHEonEllLzVYyzRHpD74WVUOiSaoulEQRoX_80/?taken-by=lovethepecks) that felt too challenging for you, only to watch you conquer it. You'd run and climb for hours, and you were having so much fun. We started wondering what we'd do to make it through the cold winter days (enough warm clothing? books? board games?) when going to the park would be more difficult. There was the "froggy" park at 207th and Seaman, the Indian Road playground in Inwood Hills park, and J. Hood Wright park at Fort Washington ave and 173rd street. You [learned to ride your first balance bike](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnAIb1lFAwmssiyXdPCWcBuQJVQ2l-S0HmQlkQ0/?taken-by=lovethepecks) (a lender from Mirren) at the parks, sometimes with [help from Baxter Bunny and Ducky](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlV-x2nlL-fFqgTieYmSl4COlwPesDcjHUy26E0/?taken-by=lovethepecks). It was also the summer that we installed [a bike seat on my bike](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlQ8xLRFBo26pwiUuM9o03qMRKH74IKLm9MYuw0/?taken-by=lovethepecks) so that you could ride along with me. You and I biked to school twice (a difficult traffic-laden ride) and would have done it more if the routes to school had been safer. We also road around the parks going nowhere in particular just exploring the hills, paths, and the jogging trail by the Marina.
* **Your friends**. You're lucky to have a lot of them right now. Isaac, Luke, and Mirren are all the kids of our friends. You also have school friends and Isaac is one of them, though he's moving to a new school this fall. Your other school friends are Leela, Elaine, Leon, Linden, and Eloise. There's a really strong E/L game going at Bright Horizons.
