Yesterday Mama went for a hike and the three of us stayed home. The weather was a little chill and it was overcast, in short it was perfect sweater weather. I drank coffee while we had introvert friendly fun. 

Henry, you played with magnet tiles and bounced, bounced, bounced.

Leo, you and I played our version of Blokus, taking all of the pieces and trying to fix them together on the board without any empty space in the middle. You're getting good at the puzzle. Then we played My First Orchard, the board game where the raven tries to eat the fruit and we try to put it in the basket. We hadn't played that for six months and you've gotten much better at taking turns.

We read six or seven books for fun (not just because it was pre-nap or pre-bed time). Then I got out the black foam pads we keep for houseguests and Leo built a slide. It turned into a jumping platform, but it was good fun.

... HENRY, you're wailing from the other room. It's 5:30am. I'm really trying to get some alone time here to write and think.
