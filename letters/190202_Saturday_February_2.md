Hi guys,

You probably won't notice the gap but it's been three weeks since my last letter. Nasty head cold. Sleep regression and re-sleep training Henry. And one week I felt the need to increase the privacy of these letters by moving them to a new Github account that would be harder for other people to find (or associate with your parents). The photo links are still a giveaway to your identity, but I'm not trying for perfect privacy. What I'm aiming for is something where I can speak to you candidly, keep the letters publicly readable so you won't need a password to read them in the future, and to set it all up so that it will be difficult for someone to stumble across these by accident. 

You might be laughing at all of this. I can imagine that in another ten to twenty years that a) you'll be so accustomed to data about your lives being shared and collected with (and without) your consent these letters will be just another drop in the bucket. Or b) AI will have gotten good enough at connecting the dots to associate this content with you and it will be a moot point. 

Speaking of AI, here are a few things I was talking with your grandma and grandpa about recently. 

Grandma sent this article: 

https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-collar-robots-are-coming-for-jobs-11548939601

And I replied with: 

*You might enjoy this piece on "becoming a centaur:"* https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-case

*Here's the gist: AI will work best when it works in collaboration with a person. Most people will have their jobs replaced, but not entirely by AI... but by a very select number of people who know how to collaborate with the AI tools will do the job better than either a large pool of humans or an AI alone.* 

*So, to use the Amelia example from the article from WSJ: Amelia will be able to deal with 95% of the queries, because she's seen them before and they're known fixes. But when she doesn't know the answer or when she isn't able to deal with the emotional state of the person she's talking to... she'll escalate it to a highly skilled human. Someone who can create a deeper emotional bond with the person they're talking with and who can do more lateral thinking to solve a problem without a known solution.* 

*PayPal and Palantir both use this sort of AI and human partnerships. PayPal's found it's the most effective way to fight fraudulent charges and attempts to steal money from users. Palantir uses with in collaboration with the DOD to analyze potential terrorist activities.* 

*For the worker, this is all part of a much bigger conversation about digital literacy, the rate of technological change, and what the future of work looks like. The long and short of it being (and this is not particularly new, just more exaggerated than before) that if you don't understand the new wave of technological changes you'll be left behind. I think Doug Rushkoff's book Program or Be Programmed is a great read on the subject (his 2010 SXSW talk recaps the ideas of the book in 5 minutes).* 

*Thanks for sending this our way. This topic is a really big deal.*

... when she asked if I had any more on the subject I shared this: 

_Required reading on AI includes Tim Urban’s veeeeeeeerrrrrry long two part essay on the subject. Think short book length. Fortunately, he explains it all in layman’s terms and adds funny poorly drawn comics so it’s a fun read._ 

https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html

https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html

*Then a real life example of AI going terribly wrong. Mostly harmless, but a real-life cautionary tale. Compliments of Microsoft.* 

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/03/24/microsofts-teen-girl-ai-turns-into-a-hitler-loving-sex-robot-wit/

*Two more pieces about AI and automation changing the landscape of work.* 

https://www.wired.com/2017/02/ai-threat-isnt-skynet-end-middle-class/

https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603465/the-relentless-pace-of-automation/

*And then two about AI and security research/applications. The one with the AI fight club is particularly fascinating, because that’s one of the most effective ways we have (currently) to train AI.* 

https://www.wired.com/2016/06/googles-android-security-team-turns-machine-learning/

https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608288/ai-fight-club-could-help-save-us-from-a-future-of-super-smart-cyberattacks/

You're reading this from the future. How do these old articles about AI hold up? How did jobs and work change? What's your relationship to AI?

This is a topic that I like, and I'm sharing it because I want you all to know what I'm thinking about professionally and to satisfy my larger curiosity. 

So... on to the cute stuff that's happened in the past few weeks. 

Henry, 

You continue to be [the happiest and chillest baby](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtD9teBgfVxacMuwvJwftom7L9eb9LwLLoquEM0/) on the block. Seriously dude, you're so easy and happy right now. It's a joy. _You're_ a joy. You've also started to "talk back" to us. When we coo at you with "ooooo" and "aaaaahhhhh" you coo right back at us. You're happy about it too and it _feels_ like you get the joke that there's this back and forth thing going on and that you want to be a part of it. 


Leo, 

[You took a selfie.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs1MdWNAPdPQQ0JW1i5pajg9i0OnZqCnR6GZL40/) [You can't get enough of puzzles.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs3wW6tgAjVuZL-tKCkUS9JrePSvb60rj0fDto0/) You're addicted to sleeper pajamas, especially [this pair that Tia got you for Xmas](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs8IVgjg9PJ3baBohXmfXTugkT-eHQZmS3vuFs0/) because it has a hood and pockets. We're started going to the local Y on the weekends during open gym. You've got a balance bike, but this was [your first time on a bike/trike with pedals](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtCPLwzAdHyKGhscSePquRKjhIMee7aIdNeaww0/). When I told you to push down on the pedals, you took me literally and pushed down on both at the same time. We worked on the left, right, left, right pattern a bit but you preferred to walk it around. 

You're using a sleep light, a timer/app based LED light that turns red and plays white noise when it's time to go to bed, and that turns green when it's time to wake up. You're really taking to the system ([operant conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning), baby). And it's part of the process we're rolling out for you and Henry to share a room. You learn not to get out of bed until the light turns green, and then down the road when we move you into a toddler bed without a side on it the hope is that you'll stay in bed or in your room until the light turns green. 

Anyway, that's a long walk to the point: you said something cute during bedtime. We've got a whole series of things we say back and forth after I put you into your crib. Good night. Sleep tight. I love you. See you in the morning. See you tomorrow. For a while we were doing a version of [Skidamarink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skidamarink) as a call and response. 

> I love you in the morning
And in the afternoon
I love you in the evening
And underneath the moon

> Skidamarink a-dink a-dink
Skidamarink a-doo
I love you

Then you learned what weekends are and for a month or so would wish me a good weekend every night. Well, a few weeks ago you were starting to say _"Have a great weekend!"_ when you stumbled on the words and say _"Have a grape!"_ You paused, and we both busted out laughing. It was a really funny mistake. So for a few days we were telling each other to "Have a grape!" Then, with no prompting, you told me the other night "Have a blueberry!" I about died laughing. 

So there it is, one of your first, original jokes. And it was a good one! 

I love how much you make me laugh. I can see the twinkle in your eye when you see it's worked. I love making _you_ laugh. I hope that this is something we keep doing for each other over the years, because that would be a really cool layer of our relationship. 

Henry, you got to meet Seth and Helene this month when we went up to have brunch with them. Leo, you and Seth played for hours. Drawing on butcher paper, and throwing a streamer of paper down their stairwell. You also did really well with Baxter, who was as always super energetic and licked you a lot, but this time even though you didn't like it you said "No!" and asked for help. He eventually calmed down and spent more time indoors around us. You two are getting more acclimated to each other. He'll probably be the dog you end up hanging out with the most on a regular basis. 

Well, I think that's about it for this week. As always, it's an incomplete record of the beautiful and trying things you two do. Until next week.
