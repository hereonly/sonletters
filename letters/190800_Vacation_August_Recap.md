# August Vacation Recap

**Thursday - 8/1**
You went to school and Mama and I had a date day for writing and big picture dreaming. 

**Friday - 8/2**
We had a beach day double-header. In the morning we went to Rye beach. Then while Henry was napping in the car we drove to City Island to take a look around. Then we went to Orchard Beach in the Bronx. 

**Saturday - 8/3**
We went for a hike in the park. Then we got veggies from the farmer's market. You all played with toys until nap time. After nap time, Leo and I got on my bike and rode down to Discovery Playground. 

**Sunday - 8/4**
We went to Riverbank State Park and swam in the pool. After nap time, we had a picnic in the park with Kevin, Mirren, and Isabelle. 

**Monday - 8/5**
CMOM! Children's Museum of Manhattan. This place was five floors of wow! We had a picnic on the benches in the middle of Broadway and watched the cars while we ate. After nap time, Leo and I went to the library (unplanned playdate with Martin) and LEO GOT HIS OWN LIBRARY CARD. 

**Tuesday - 8/6**
The boys went to school. Sarah and I went to Hanuman. Then we had a low-key writing and _Veronica Mars_ binge day.

**Wednesday - 8/7**
Leo and I went to the American Museum of Natural History with Seth. We saw the T-Rex special exhibit. After nap time, the whole family went to Indian Road playground and then Indian Road Cafe for dinner. 

**Thursday - 8/8**
The boys went to school. Sarah and I went to Robert Moses State Park Beach on Fire Island. We played in the waves (which were too big for adults to handle without supervision) and read books in the sun.

**Friday - 8/9**
Leo and I went to the swimming pool. I forgot the floaties, so it was a quick trip. After nap time, Leo, Henry and I stayed home while Mama, Ellen, and Matt went to see _Book of Mormon_. 

**Saturday - 8/10**
I got the boys up early and shuttled us out of the house at 6:30am so that Mama, Ellen, and Matt could sleep in. We had a breakfast picnic at the playground, and played there with Luke and Claire until about 10am when MEM came to join us. Then we had an early nap time, and Ms. B came over to babysit and put the boys to bed. Ellen and Matt went to Long Island for the birthday party, and Mama and I met up with Margo and Brian to see Hannah Gatsby's show _Douglas_. We stayed out late drinking in Manhattan and ended the evening at a karaoke bar. 

**Sunday - 8/11**
Despite the hangover, I got Leo and Henry up early and Mama slept in. Then around 9am I took Leo to the pool (with floaties). After nap time, we had an early bed time and passed out.

**Monday - 8/12**
Mama let me sleep in, and took Henry and Leo to the playground with Matt and Ellen. I met up with them and then took Leo to the Bronx Zoo. There was a Dinosaur Safari hayride. Leo soaked up the children's zoo. And then we rode the underwhelming Zoo Shuttle around the park (we need to go back for the Nature Walk which is a collection of rope bridges). After nap time, we went to Seth and Helene's house for dinner. Leo got carsick and threw up on the way there. 

Tuesday - 8/13
Matt left. The boys went to school. Sarah and I went to Hanuman, and then had a low-key recovery day.

Wednesday - 8/14
Ellen left, Tia arrived. Leo and I went to the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn to see the old trains. The Highlight were the busses he could dive and the folding paper bus they gave him at the lunchroom. After nap time, we had dinner with Tia. 

Thursday - 8/15
We packed up the car, picked the boys up from daycare early, and drove to Wildwood State Park on Long Island. We were in the same spot C 15 that exactly four years early we'd been in when we conceived Leo. 

Friday - 8/16
We woke up at Wildwood, went swimming in the Long Island Sound, made a big fire, ate s'mores, took naps, read books in the hammock, Henry played "soccer" by chasing a ball around the camp site, and Leo kept dragging his chair further and further back form the fire.

Saturday - 8/17
My 38th Birthday. We woke up in the woods and had Pie and coffee for breakfast (along with bacon and eggs). We packed up camp and drove home. Pizza and beer for dinner. After bed Tia and Sarah watched trashy TV while I read my book. 

Sunday - 8/18
We went to Brooklyn to visit the Smiths, who just bought a beautiful new condo on the Williamsburg waterfront. After nap time, Leo and I went to the library to get books for the trip.

Monday - 8/19
The boys went to daycare, and Sarah and I had a low-key recovery day.
