Henry, you're sleep training again. There was a little relapse after you got your latest round of vaccines. Totally normal. You're still [the smiliest baby on the block](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsWJn9yg943ooT1oNqtWNtaAFB1chez60Qc2Is0/). 

Officially three months in and [you're off the charts](https://www.instagram.com/p/BsYoUMggGlq8pUIRrXDQ1mkl6PDXCfF3Q-jA1M0/).  17 lbs 2 oz. 97th percentile.
41.3 cm head circumference. 73rd percentile. 
27 inches long (2'3"). Off the charts. 

Not that you really asked, and probably this is too much information. Did you know that when a baby gets to be a few months old (not the first few weeks) they can go quite a while without pooping? It's true. Mostly for breastfed babies. Formula (in 2019) can often constipate a baby so different advice if the baby is eating formula. 

Turns out that some babies can be super efficient at digesting the breast milk and can go days (or two weeks) without pooping. 

Guess who's one of those babies? 

Safety tip: if the baby isn't peeing regularly talk to your doctor. 

Anyway your finally dropped the motherload after ten days of not pooping. It was gross, but you seemed to feel better. So you're efficient, but also it should come out. 

Oh! The rings. You've started grabbing the rings on the play mat. You'll focus on them with your eyes, reach for them, and grab. Three awesome skills woven into one activity. Milestone, my man, milestone. 

Leo, we got you a sleep light. It turns red when it's time to go to bed and it turns green when you're allowed to get up. You still wake up around 5:30am, but now you're staying in bed and not yelling for us until about the light turns green at 6:30.

You've made me a morning person. It was a rough adjustment in the beginning, but overall it's a good change for me. 

So, what's up with me you ask? 

Well, it turns out I was pushing myself a little too hard or fast in the gym. I stressed out my pelvic floor muscles or tweaked some nerves in my spine. Not sure which, but shortly before Henry was born I had a few major incontinence episodes. 

Embarrassing I know, and little scary to not be in control of your body. I went to see a series of doctors. 

First my general practitioner, who said it was highly atypical for a 37 year old man in otherwise fine health and that we should take it seriously. So a referral to a urologist to make sure it wasn't prostate cancer. 

The urologist couldn't find anything and escalated the case to a neurologist to make sure it was spinal damage or early signs of a degenerative disease. 

All the tests came back normal from the neurologist, so after she talked with the urologist, I had one more check in with the urologist. 

No one can explain it, which sucks, but it also hasn't happened again. All the doctors cautioned me to take it easy with the weightlifting. The urologist knew the most about it because he does some himself. 

At this point I'm deadlifting more than my body weight and overhead pressing half my body weight. Both of which are pretty significant milestones. I got into weightlifting for the long-term health benefits, that's what it's for. So if I'm working against my goal by doing too much of it it's easy to back off.

I've started doing more core work since I saw the neurologist to help strengthen my stabilizers and my pelvic floor. But I pushed it a little too hard the morning before I saw the urologist. I think I was (stupidly) trying to push my body so that if there was something to see related to exercise it would come out. 

My best analysis right now says that I was over arching my back while doing overhead press and compressing my spine in a damaging way. Adding to that I was deadlifting more than I'd ever done before and had recently added incline sit-ups while holding a weight to my routine. So I was putting a tremendous amount of pressure on my pelvic muscles. 

I'm easing back. Still going to lift, but going to slow down the rate at which I build progressive overload. I added a heavy/light split to my workout to help "grease the groove" and improve my form as well as strengthen the stabilizer muscles involved in these exercises. 

I'm also adding in my cardio. It's good for my heart and my blood pressure. 

I'm making commitments each day to help protect my health so that I'll be here for you both for as long as I can. 

I love you.
