Hello my loves, 

It's a been a minute. What's happening? 

Henry, you're walking, and _talking_. Bird. Dog. Pizza. Apple. Mama. Dada. I'm excited for the day you say Leo's name for the first time. You're able to climb up onto the bench by the living room table and look out the window at Broadway. You're being very careful as you do it. You hold the table and then reach for the window ledge. You look out at the cars and the people walking by. If you see a flock of pigeons fly by you say "bir" "bir" and look to see if we saw it too. 

You're an opportunist, and unabashed. We got a note from Ms. Nina at Bright Horizons that you loved your morning snack (vanilla yogurt and blueberries) so much that when another kid didn't eat theirs you got up, went to their spot, sat down, and ate their meal. 

You're growing so fast. You need your fuel! 

You're also a second child, which means maybe you take your openings when you see them. You're ready to claim the good that comes your way. 

Leo, you're so full of questions and imaginative play. You showed me a trick you invented on your scooter as we came home from BH the other night. It was called a "ride pop." and was like a wheelie for a scooter. You want to know what's funny. You ask "is that funny?" all day long. "I'm wearing two pairs of pants—is that funny?" "I mixed my peanut butter with my yogurt—is that funny?" "We walked a different way to the subway—is that funny?" 

You and your friends at school talk about about the PJ Masks (Owlette, Catboy, and Gecko) and Paw Patrol (Marshall, Skye, Chase, Rubble, ...). I'm not sure if you know that there are TV shows for these characters, but we pretend that we're those characters. You'll declare that you're Catboy or Owlette and ask who we want to be. Then we'll run really fast if we're Catboy or flap our wings to fly if we're Owlette. Gecko gets short shrift. The Paw Patrol has jobs like firefighter, police officer, helicopter pilot and you're teaching me what each of them do so that I know how to play along. 

Our friends Kevin, Isabelle, and Mirren just welcomed baby Ida into their family. I really like them. I hope at the time you're reading these letters we're still friends with them. 

We're getting closer to our move to Dobbs Ferry. We're in contract on a place, but there's still a lot of paperwork to do. We don't know when the move will be exactly, but at the end of this month you two will transfer form Bright Horizons at New York Presbyterian to a Bright Horizons in Westchester. 

I'll start driving you up on my way to work. We can't buy our own car until after closing, which means I'm using a ZipCar commuter plan to get access to a car M-F. We'll use the red wagon to take the carseats to the parking lot. Load up the car on Monday morning, then leave the carseats in until Friday afternoon when we wagon everything back again. 

Will car sharing and car ownership even make sense in the future? We wonder. Or will it just be fleets of autonomous cars driving themselves around and you hail them when you need a lift. Personally, I'm looking forward to the idea of autonomous cars. Driving is a fun skill, but as a daily requirement it can be a drag. Also, the stupidest risks I ever took as a teenager involved driving a car. I'd _love_ to rule out those risks for you two when you're old enough to drive. I'll still teach you to drive, a little like I teach you wilderness survival skills. It's a fun thing to know which you might only use in an emergency, but which probably won't be a part of your daily life. 

The sun is up. It's probably time to get you two up. 

I love you. 

PS - It's good to write to you again. You two are such a joy. I want to hold on to all the wonderful moments we're having together.
