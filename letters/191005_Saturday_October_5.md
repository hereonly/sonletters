Henry, 

You're _almost_ one year old. 

CONGRATULATIONS! 

Hooray! 

HAPPY BIRTHDAY! 

My son, you're such a treasure to me. I love you. I'm so grateful that you're a part of our family. It's been a long year, and maybe if you have kids you'll experience this too, that joyful as it is the first year of a someone's life is a demanding time. I'm glad we were able to give you the time and energy you needed, you're worth it.

We can see your frustration as you become more aware of your surrounds, more aware of your desires, and more aware that you can't yet be understood by the people around you. There's a chasm ahead of you. On the other side is speaking, and being heard, being understood. When you cross to the other side it will be so much easier and faster to get your needs met. To have your questions answered, to get help getting the things you desire. There will still be plenty left to learn, because getting what you want and need is not always easy.

> "Life is tough, but when you're tough on yourself life is infinitely more rewarding." —Zig Ziglar.

We'll help you learn the rest as you grow older. That's our commitment to you as parents. As a family. Leo's already helping. Last week, I was in the kitchen getting your lunch ready for school. When I came out to check on how breakfast was going I noticed Leo showing you the sign language for "food" and telling you the word. We'll teach you, and you'll teach us. We'll help you, and you'll help us. All of us together. And all of the people in our larger community of friends and family. 

You have a large, caring community who loves you: Dada, Mama, Leo, Mimi, Papa, Tia, Susan, Kieran, Robert, Ellen, Grandma, Grandpa, Grandma Debbie, Ms. B, the teachers at your school, Seth, Helene, Ishita, Sean, and so many family friends. 

You're going to build to that community as you get older. You'll make your own friends. You'll decide who to surround yourself with. You'll bring those people into the circle so that we can all meet each other and support each other. As you grow older the people you choose will become a bigger and bigger part of your life. If you're lucky, if you're kind, if you're honest and trustworthy—and I expect you'll be all of those things—you'll have amazing friends who support and love you, the kind of friends that you consider family and who are there for you in the good times and the rough times. 

I love you. 

You're an awesome person.

I love you for being who you are. There's nothing you need to do to earn my love. There's nothing you can do to lose my love. I'm with you, in person or in your heart, forever. I'm so grateful to feel that love for you. I'm grateful to be your father. I'm so excited and hopeful for what the future may bring you. 

Love, 
Dad
