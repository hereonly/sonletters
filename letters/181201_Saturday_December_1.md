[Henry at two months](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqqVcLhAzxcjw1HT1cqyBkfUEAhho8ISE9pZFw0/) and [Leo at two-and-a-half](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqqUxPggBghtdwnX8f0YpL2THtAmy1rF9FSKB40/). We had family portraits taken recently, and you guys look stunning. Cheeks for days, big eyes. My sons. 

I love you both. It's still sleep deprivation nation over here. I texted your mother some gibberish this past week because I hit a new low of exhaustion mania over the week. 

> "I am feeling the slow slog of strangeness barfing through my brain. The result of sleep deprivation I'm sure. I feel compelled to say the weirdest things, but I'm taking your advice to just say as little as possible so they don't know how tired I am."

> "Yikes, what a thing to sleep and not sleep and feel your world blurring around you. It's almost like Dada-ist poetry the way the aphasia seems to affect the words I pick to use to explain myself in everyday logistics. _'I can do that after I get the clothes out of the dishwasher, no toaster-waffle, no. No. I...'_ 'I know what you mean.' _'Thanks'_ That's how the conversation goes."

Henry, you're sleeping through big chunks of the night. I appreciate that. But you're not _going_ to sleep until 9:30+ which means that by the time I wake up at 4am. I'm getting about six hours, interrupted. I really, really want you to conk out hard at 7:30 after Leo goes to bed. I really really want to fall asleep for eight hours. I could sleep in, I know. Your mother reminded me of that last night, but I don't function as well during the day if I wake up to screaming and don't get a minute to myself with coffee and my journal. I need to get my head on straight and have a little time for _me_ before I pour myself into the service of my work and caring for my family. Those things are fulfilling, yes, but they also ask so much and it's important (vital, really) to have something to energize me before it all starts.

In Julia Cameron's _The Artist's Way_ she talks about "filling the pond" so that when you come to fish from it, you don't leave it empty. Each morning is a kind of artist's date with myself. I use this time to fill the pond, to energize myself, to connect with the work that I most want to be doing in the world. It's healthy for the soul* even if it's not the best choice I could make for my body. 

* _by which I mean, that part of us which is greater than the sum of the parts._

"Sometimes you've got to stay up late playing the violin to fight off a cold." I forget the source, but that phrase comes from some book about creativity that I read during my adolescence. The idea was that when the author started to feel the first twinges of a cold—low energy, a mild tickle in the throat, the saggy depression of sickness approaching—that instead of taking to bed and resting they did something they loved that thrilled them. In this case: they stayed up late and played their violin in the moonlight. By communing with an activity that they truly loved (not just cheap comfort) they energized themselves in a way that helped them fight off the cold. 

Take all of that with a grain of salt, and please get your flu shots. Modern medicine is a miracle of human achievement and the scientific process. Good sleep hygiene is a keystone habit. That said, I think the takeaway from the violin story is that you should know what it is you truly love to do, and you should pay attention to the relationship between doing that thing and the way you feel. 

> "_Truly_ love? What is _untruly_ loving Dad? Enough with the semantics old man, give it to us straight."

Ok boys, it goes like this: There are things that are fun, they are easy, they give us a dopamine hit and require very little from us. They're candy-sugar-sex-drug-like activities. It's very easy to enjoy doing them, but on the other side of having done them, they leave you feeling flat and unfulfilled. Something that you truly love doing will leave you feeling exhilarated and stirred up on the other side. It will not always be easy or convenient, in fact it will often be damn near the most demanding thing you do during your day. Maybe it's not physical labor, but it's an [emotional](https://seths.blog/2017/05/emotional-labor/) [labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_labor) that requires you to dance with the fear of failure and to swim in feelings that you'd like to rage against or run from and instead of _reacting_ to them instead acting despite them. 

[Convenience is not all it is cracked up to be](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/opinion/sunday/tyranny-convenience.html). Quotes from the article by Tim Wu below.

> "As if to mask the issue, we give other names to our inconvenient choices: We call them hobbies, avocations, callings, passions. These are the noninstrumental activities that help to define us. They reward us with character because they involve an encounter with meaningful resistance — with nature’s laws, with the limits of our own bodies — as in carving wood, melding raw ingredients, fixing a broken appliance, writing code, timing waves or facing the point when the runner’s legs and lungs begin to rebel against him.

> "Such activities take time, but they also give us time back. They expose us to the risk of frustration and failure, but they also can teach us something about the world and our place in it."

So what do you truly love to do? I don't know for you yet, but you'll figure it out. I'm invested in helping you discover what it is. And it will change as you grow and learn. The thing that makes your eyes light up this year may start to leave you flat the following year. _This. Is. Normal._ It can be frustrating to  have a beloved activity shift under your feet and leave you listless and bored, but it just means that you drank deeply and got everything you needed from it. 

That's okay. Time to move on, maybe. Or maybe not.

It might be that you're in love with the quick uptick in skill development that comes from learning the first 60% of anything fairly competently, but that the slow, grueling work of getting to 80% or 95% to the level of a professional isn't "fun." You're not alone in feeling that way, which is why picking something valuable (valued by the market and also valuable to the human species) and sticking it out is good career advice. Doing the things other people aren't willing to do is a way to succeed. More on skill development in [Cal Newport's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Newport) books, especially _So Good They Can't Ignore You_ and _Deep Work_. [Here's a primer from his blog about self-determination theory: autonomy, competence, relatedness and how it related to career and passion](http://calnewport.com/blog/2010/01/23/beyond-passion-the-science-of-loving-what-you-do/).

Some things are worth the squeeze even when it's _you_ that's being squeezed. But not everything has to be the one thing that keeps you going. If you decide something is going to make for good career capital or an [asset](https://seths.blog/2013/04/where-are-your-assets/) then it's fine to stick through the hard seasons when it doesn't fill you up (it's cyclical and it might again, like love it can come and go and come again). But if it's not something you're building your career on, [know when to quit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dip) it and move on. Get what you came for and move on. Stay in touch with how doing it makes you feel, and when it's no longer energizing you, move on to the thing that does. Listen to yourself. Be honest with yourself. It can be really appealing to persuade yourself that something still feels good when it doesn't anymore—maybe that thing that used to energize you came with a lot of external status or maybe it's something your friends still enjoy doing. There are lots of reasons why you might want to blind yourself to how it really makes you feel, but you need to trust yourself and listen to your body. Know what it is you truly love to do. Even if you can't or don't do that thing anymore, be honest with yourself.

I think that's about it for today my sons. I love you. Until next time.
