We've kicked off summer vacation with a bang! 

Thursday - 8/1 - You went to school and Mama and I had a date day for writing and big picture dreaming. 

Friday - 8/2 - We had a beach day double-header. In the morning we went to Rye beach. Then while Henry was napping in the car we drove to City Island to take a look around. Then we went to Orchard Beach in the Bronx. 

Saturday - 8/3 - We went for a hike in the park. Then we got veggies from the farmer's market. You all played with toys until nap time. After nap time, Leo and I got on my bike and rode down to Discovery Playground. 

Sunday - 8/4 - We went to Riverbank State Park and swam in the pool. After nap time, we had a picnic in the park with Kevin, Mirren, and Isabelle. 

It's been so much fun. Maybe it's not working. Maybe it's the sunshine. Maybe it's getting to spend time with people I love. Whatever it is I've been having the best summer so far. 

Today we're planning an adventure to the Children's Museum of Manhattan which looks like a five story playground with sensory tables and other fun activities. It's up in the air if Henry and Mama will come to the museum, but definitely Leo and I are going. The other option was going to be the Intrepid Museum. This Wednesday we've got the Natural History Museum with Seth. So I need to make sure we've got a day for the NY Transit Museum too because Leo really wants to see all of the trains. 

... 

and you're up!
