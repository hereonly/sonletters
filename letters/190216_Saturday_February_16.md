Hi guys, 

How are you? In this bit of space and time Leo's sick and Henry has learned to laugh. A few cute things from the past few weeks.

Leo, we're a few weeks into you asking _"Why, why, why, why, why?"_ and I love this new phase. 

Parenting young children involves a ton of [modeling behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modeling_(psychology)) and [conditioning behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning). _"Why?"_ opens the door to teaching in a more conscious and verbal way. I'm super excited to dialogue with you about the world. We're not quite ready for [Socratic dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) but you (like most young kids) seem to have a handle on [Sakichi Toyoda's Five Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) and a thirst to get to [first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle).

You stumped me the other day. It's the first of many times that's going to happen. You asked "where is the moon going?" and I told you it was coming up from here (pointing to the Eastern horizon) and going to the top of the sky and going down there (pointing to the Western horizon). "Why?" The moon follows the path of the sun I said, and then as I thought about it I realized that didn't seem true and I didn't know the answer. You asking _why_ the moon followed the sun might have helped me realize it wasn't true. :) I pulled out my phone and asked it if the moon followed the sun and it doesn't. The actual path of the moon was too complex for me to parse while carrying you on my shoulders from daycare to the subway, but I knew that I didn't know the answer and I couldn't give you a satisfying answer about [the moon's orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon). 

Even now that wikipedia article isn't particularly illuminating. I was pleased to know that even your godfather Seth didn't have the info at his fingertips. It's rare that that happens so I like that your first real stumper got all of us. 

[This article from Cornell University](http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/46-our-solar-system/the-moon/observing-the-moon/128-how-does-the-position-of-moonrise-and-moonset-change-intermediate) makes it much clearer, that actually yes the moon does follow the path of the sun (not exactly, but roughly) East to West each day with variation for moon phase and season.

_Anyway_, as you can see this phase of asking why is gonna be fun for me too because of all the new things I get to learn. 

I try my best to give you a truthful answer to every question you ask, boiling down the essentials of the answer and leaving out the details that add nuance and complexity. We'll get to nuance and complexity when you're 3 or 4! For now, my darling two-and-a-half-year-old we'll stick the basic underlying concepts. It's a good game and test for me of how well I understand the world. Can I explain something complex using simple language and still get to the heart of the answer. 

Metaphor makes it easier, but it's often incorrect. _Why is the moon bright?_ It's glowing. Well, sure, that's a fine enough answer, but it teaches the wrong underlying concept. The moon doesn't create light, it reflects light. It's not harder at this point to understand reflecting light vs. creating light. Both of those concepts are easy enough and hard enough to really grasp. So when I pick my words to explain things I try to make sure the underlying concept is true. 

In other news, your imaginative play is off the charts Leo. 

The other day we were in the kitchen when you stepped through the doorway, opening an imaginary door as you did. You turned around, punched a button in mid-air, and then started bending at the knees and slowly squatting as you counted down, three, two, one. Then you stood up, opened another imaginary door, got something in your hand, started pulling it in a circle. You came back to the imaginary door, opened it, punched another invisible button, squatted down and slowly started standing up as you counted one, two, three, opened the door, closed it and stepped back into the kitchen and announced gleefully. "I just went to the grocery store!"

You're in preschool, and your teachers are Ms. Michelle and Ms. Megan. Your teacher from the two's room, Ms. B, has started helping us out with pick-up and drop-off from school. She comes to get you in the mornings and you go with her on the train to school. She's a delight and really enjoys commuting with you because she says she always gets a seat on the train and people want to talk to you. This is a huge help to us since I'm already at work by the time you go to school, and it saves mom two hours of commuting time to pay for one hour of babysitting. Since it's on the way for Ms. B it's fun and a good way to make a little extra money. You seem to really enjoy it too, or at least that's the way it feels right now. So win-win-win. 

You'll ask in the mornings who's going to take you to school that day and who's picking you up. When I pick you up unexpectedly because mama needs more time, you point out to me that she was supposed to get you. Then you give me a hug and we check in on what you're doing at preschool. The last few times we've played a game called "around, around, around" which is just me waving my arms while I chant "around, around, around, around, around, around, around..." while you, Leela, Hallie, and Elaine run in circles around me. It's a hit right now and the other kids run over when then see I've arrived to ask to play it. It feels great to be able to make you all giggle so easily. 

Ms. Michelle and the administrators worked really hard this past year to get NYC Department of Education accreditation for their school (daycare, it's a daycare but we call it a school, though now that it's accredited it's not a stretch to call it a school). Huge amounts of work, but what I means is that in the fall when 3-K programs roll out you'll be covered. This is a huge win for our family. We can take you and Henry to the same school, and your tuition will be free (nine months out of the year) for 3-K and Universal Pre-K. After that it's Kindergarten and public school. It's been a huge load financially paying for daycare. Your tuition alone was more than our rent. We're so grateful for NYC offering 3-K funding (thanks Mayor de Blasio) and for your school doing the hard work to be ready for it. They're one of the only places that was ready to take advantage of the program when it rolled out. 

Henry, you're starting school/daycare on Tuesday. It's bittersweet for us to let you go. We know it's good for you to learn to trust other adults to take care of you and to socialize with other babies. It's good for us because it really does take a village to raise a child, and because showing you our lives as self-actualized adults who spend our time working on projects that matter is a big part of good parenting. Despite all of that, it just feels hard to cross another threshold of letting go. Our job is to help foster your autonomy, resilience, and competencyâ€”all while helping you understand yourself and to provide emotional/psychological and logistical security. We get it, but it's hard. We'd like very much to just hold you both in our laps, squeeze you in big, big hugs, and never let go. It's tough to let go a little. To know that other people can care for you. To know you'll learn to love other adults and that you won't just be our little babies. It's tough to spend time away from you when we could be close to you. And so, we're filled with sadness, hope, and a little regret as we transition you to daycare. You're only four months old. You're so young. In the end, we trust it's the right call. It's just tough for parents to let go. It's the first of so so many times we're going to have to do it on your journey of growing up. 

We love you. We love you both. 

That's usually all I'm really trying to say with these letters. 

xo,
Dada
