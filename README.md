# Introduction

Dear Leo and Henry, 

These are all the things I can think to teach you. That's my gift to you: everything I've learned that's worth passing on.

In the best case, these letters are painfully redundant because I've taught it all to you as we've lived our lives together. That's my hope. I'm writing them anyway because the process of writing them helps me clarify my thinking around each of these things I want to teach you. 

In the worst case, and I'm crying as I write this, you've found these because I included a link to them in our will. If I'm not here for you anymore, please know that these letters are ultimately a gift of love from me to you. 

The first thing is this: I love to learn, and I value learning above all else. I hope you'll share this love of learning with me, and from what I've seen so far I know you do.

Watching you grow up I get to witness your curiosity blossom. Keep following the questions and the curiosity, and you will have a life worth living.

I love you. 

Dada


# Table of Contents

These letters are as short or as long as they need to be. "Letters" might not even be the right word for them, but that's what I'm going with.

I'm writing around a handful of major themes:
* Lessons learned / advice
* Your father's beliefs + mental models
* Formative moments (for me and you)
* Stories about our family (immediate and extended)
* Stories from watching you grow up
* Books to read
* Great questions
* I love you

It occurs to me that what I share will reveal more about me than about life itself. I hope you'll find it useful too, but if nothing else it will help you paint a picture of your father's inner life. The things I've needed to hear in my life and which I've made an effort to remind myself of over the years. Things I've used to direct my trajectory or counterbalance my habits.

A note on style: I'm only two letters in and I'm using "mother," "mama," "mom," interchangeably. We call ourselves "Mama" and "Dada" right now, but who knows what you'll call us in the years between when I write these and when you read them. I'm just going to be gloriously inconsistent and love that. If it's weird for you when you read, so be it. xoxo

A note on privacy: I'm linking to a private instagram account for most of the photos. You'll have access, and I think they'll stay in business for enough years to keep hosting the images securely (since they're owned by Facebook). I'm also name-checking our and your friends. The stories I'm telling are personal, but I'm working to keep them from being too revealing while still honest and intimate. This place I'm keeping them is a public repository (so you and everyone else has access if they know where to look for it), but I've renamed the branch from "master" to "main" to exclude it from search engines. That means what's said in here isn't private, but it's also not easy to find when searching.

A note on spelling: I'm using a text editor that makes writing markdown files easy and pleasurable. I've turned off the spellchecker because stopping to notice my mistakes distracts me from the idea that I'm trying to communicate. Respecting the idea and getting it down on "paper" is the first hard part. Going back through the writing later to polish it up is an important part of editing or publishing, but it's not an important part of telling a story or building a persuasive argument or communicating an idea. Maybe I'll polish up this archive later. Maybe I won't. Right now, I kind of adore that all of my rough edges will show in my writing. I've had trouble with spelling words correctly since I can remember learning how to read and write. In Elementary School, I'd come home with straight A's and one F in spelling. I was never a straight A student until I started using a computer to help with my writing and discovered spell check. After that my "problems" with spelling went away. Honestly, I'm so grateful, because spelling things correctly isn't the point. It's necessary to be understood, but it's such a last minute, easy fix that in a system of work or education that uses modern tools there's no reason to have humans wrack their brains learning to spell. I tried everything that Mimi could think of to improve my spelling (and my spelling test scores, but again test-driven education is another topic). I wrote the words repeatedly, I recorded my own voice spelling the words outloud and then listened back to the recording, I used sandpaper letters with my eyes open and closed to feel the shape of each letter in a word while trying to picture the arrangement of letters in my mind. Nothing we thought up worked. Spell check did. That was the end of it. So much of education and work still needs to acknowledge that it's not important for people to learn skills that used to be required before a tool was invented to solve the problem. And this is not a new problem: [Plato argued against the invention of the written word](https://fs.blog/2013/02/an-old-argument-against-writing/) more on that in [Phaedrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedrus_(dialogue).

## Notes

... include notes from my Evernote
* Library folder

What's it for?

Who's it for?

What change are you seeking to make?

What do you want the outcome to look like? 
* Design for that.

What does it remind you of?

5 Whys — Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

Who's solved this problem before?
* How did they do it?
* What did they learn?
* How would you do it differently?

Look at it holistically
* System design
* Person + their environment
* What's the context?

Break it down into it's smallest (atomic) piece.
* What can you learn from looking at the individual pieces?

Toyota production method

Scientific management

Six sigma

Return on investment

Regression to the mean

Recursion 

Original is overrated
* Webster + Seth
* Time-, place-, and audience-specific is more important than first-ever, unique and new
* We keep telling love stories
* What does it remind you of? 
* Remix culture

Cal Newport, _So Good They Can't Ignore You_, _Deep Work_
* If you want to make something new, original you need to work through all the pre-requisite work so that you're on the forefront of the field trying things that might not work. You need to know the forefront, you need to know what your peers are doing, you need to know you're not reinventing the wheel. 

Copy and emulate to learn

Blend known quantities to create something new
* rough e.g. _Crying of Lot 49_ + human desire to divine patterns and meaning from data (and the risks of finding patterns where they don't exist) = William Gibson's _Pattern Recognition_... need a better example

Can this problem survive a rigorous workout? 
* If not, you're probably hyping up the problem. 
* Most things look worse if you're in the wrong headspace. Exercise helps to get you into the right headspace. 

Thinking is stronger when it's paired with movement.
* Walk n' talks
* Load up your brain and then exercise, see what comes out the other side

Memento mori
* Watching my hand move as a teen. The complexity of the human body. A reminder to _wake up_ while I'm alive.

_Tao Te Ching_ by Lao-Tzu / Laozi (Stephen Mitchell translation)

_A Return to Love_ by Marianne Williamson

Morning pages and journaling

Reviewing your journals
* See what it was like with the benefit of time and distance. What can you learn about who you were/are? A new perspective on old thoughts.

Therapy

Strategic time + execution time
* Having a time for deciding and a time for doing helps to keep you strategically focused and from being too reactive.
* Story/book example of deciding on a Sunday night what do to with the week. Related example: Write down the night before what you'll do in the morning. Wake up and do what your past self decided without quibbling. Related: sunk costs

Ignore Sunk costs

Known knowns, known unknowns, unknown unknowns
* Donald Rumsfeld -- "There are known knowns. There are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we now know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we do not know we don't know."
* Related, Errol Morris documentary _The Unknown Known_

Self-discipline leads to freedom
* mental and practical

Jerry Rice: "I'll do today what others wont, so that I can do tomorrow what others can't."

Prioritize jobs w/ learning > jobs with earning

"Priority" is singular. You must choose one thing. Having a list of priorities is a bit of an oxymoron.

Jay-Z: "Took me 26 years just to find my path. My only job is cut the time in half. So at 13 we'll have our first drink together. Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk. Look a man dead in his eyes so he know you talk truth. When you speak it, give your word, keep it."
* Share what I know
* Make room for you to learn and surpass me quickly

What questions are you asking yourself?

Sonder: Everyone has an inner life as rich as yours.

Making space for other people to reveal their inner lives to you.
* Everyone wears a mask, maybe many.
* Most people desperately want to share their inner life and be seen.

Read fiction. For fun and for Theory of Mind.

It's easy to criticize, it's hard to create. Creating is more valuable and more worthy.
* "The best way to complain is to make things (better)" —James Murphy + Seth Godin, and lots of others
* A good critic educates by adding context for how the work stands in relation (integrating or breaking away) with what came before it and with with else is in the world that the work is speaking to.

Shun the non-believers
* Many critics are just people that the thing was never intended for in the first place. Ignore them and shun them.

Cultural truths expire and become dated.

Platitudes, stereotypes, and jokes all have a grain of truth in them. Learn how to identify the true parts.
* Burn off the overuse and sloppy generalizations in platitudes and stereotypes to get to the core truth. Anne Bogart has a great riff about this in _A Director Prepares_.
* The truth in a joke may say more about the person telling it (or who thinks it's funny) than the subject the joke is aimed at. 
* Some of these truths are historical, and have expired.

_A Director Prepares_ by Anne Bogart

Tools + Teams - two ways to make things (no doubt there are more)
* Tools teach you how to think, how things work, skills, a relationship to craft, process and mastery. The DIY ethic loves tools.
* Teams teach you about people, communication, coordination, scale, and planning. 

Outsource the (easy) tasks, do the (hard) emotional labor. 
* Do the things other people are afraid to do—the parts of the job that scare you because they might not work. The risk of failure is a guidepost.

Photography vs. Web Design
* The more magical and mysterious a thing feels to a client, the more difficult it seems, the more they tell themselves "I can't do that"... the more valuable it is to them (in terms of market value).

Value in terms of Capitalism and Humanity
* What's valuable to Capitalism isn't always what's valuable to Humanity, but they're also not mutually exclusive.

_Poor Charlie's Almanac_ by Charlie Munger

Charlie Munger's "mental models"
* What's your list of core principles from all the different domains of human knowledge?
* How do you fit those ideas together with experience to understand the way the world works? 

Elon Musk's "explain it to me in first principles"

Stoicism

What's the in? What's the out?
* Movie production / scriptwriting terms for first and last impressions.
* People remember how it starts and ends, but they forget the middle. 

People forget what you say. They remember how you make them feel.

Status roles
* How does someone see their status?
* Does it align with how the people around them see that person's status?
* Are they trying to increase their status, decrease it, or stay the same? 
* Is their status higher or lower than yours? Is there a conflict about it?

Defenses: emotional and mental
* Visualizing armor
* Knowing when to be open and when to close yourself off

Circles of trust
* Where is this person in your circles of trust?
* How much you reveal of yourself and how vulnerable you make yourself should correspond.

Learn how to fight...
* constructively about ideas
* compassionately about differences in your relationships
* physically for your self-defense and survival

Compound interest
* for money, trust, and skill development

Keystone habits and behavior change

Shower daily, use mouthwash, brush your tongue, use deodorant, don't shampoo every day

Drink (plain) water and stay hydrated
* You should pee clear when you're hydrated

Take notes and underline in books when you read.

[Active learning](notes/active_learning.md)

Strength training for health and longevity. Focus on compound, full-body exercises and progressive overload.

Running sucks, but it's good cardio. 
* If you keep doing it longer it sucks less. Running outside is more fun than running on a treadmill. Running for a reason (soccer, capture the flag, to catch the bus) is more fun than running to run. Running can be meditative if you do it well enough for long-enough (I haven't really hit the point yet but your mother talks about it).
* If you're going to run, consider your form. Most people get knee and joint problems from running for years with bad form. Read _Born to Run_ and consider barefoot running technique.

_Born To Run_ by Christopher McDougal 

Swimming is great exercise. It's also a vital survival skill.

Biking is fun and a great way to commute around cities.
* Always wear a helmet
* Learn how to avoid getting "door-ed" 
* Look a block away and predict what the traffic and pedestrians are going to do. 
* Know that if you ride in the city you will have an accident, treat it like a given and then do everything you can to avoid it happening today.
* Lock your bike up through the frame and both tires. 
* The best commuter bike is not flashy looking. It doesn't use quick-release anything, it's all bolted on tight. Remove anything that clips on or off easily before you go inside if you don't want it stolen.
* Use front and back lights (especially during daybreak and twilight)
* Always cary a flat fix kit, a multi-tool (set of Allen wrenches), a pump, a spare tire, tire irons, and any other wrench required to change your tire or reseat your chain.
* Carry and use chain lube.
* Roll your pant leg that's next to the chain, or cuff it with a band.
* It's usually safer to ride on the street with traffic than it is to ride on the sidewalks. 
* If it's not safe, just get the hell off the road and walk your bike. 
* Don't play games with traffic. Modern life includes very few things where you'll really run the risk of death, but riding your bike in the city is one of them. You will never win against a two ton vehicle. 

Intermittent fasting
* This made a huge difference for me when I was trying to lean up my body. I gained a lot of fat around Leo's birth and worked really hard to slim down around Henry's birth. 

99 drops of sweat a day for mental clarity

Money travels light.
* Most things you forget on a trip are easy to replace. If in doubt, leave it at home because you probably won't need it. If you really do, wait a while and see if it's still true. If you really need it, buy a replacement. 

Wilderness survival
* Shelter
* Water
* Food
* Emergency medicine
* How to deal with wild animals and dangerous humans

1% inspiration/knowledge and 99% perspiration/execution

Ideas are cheap, execution is expensive. 
* Having the idea is overrated, executing on the idea is where the value is built.

Try (most) new things twice
* The first time you try something new you might experience the "newness" more than the actual thing you're trying. The second time will tell you more about the thing itself. 

Drugs
* Know how addictive they are, the specific one you're thinking of trying.
* Know whether its possible to overdose on that drug, and how frequently and likely an overdose is possible. 
* Know what if any medical complications come up when using a drug.
* Look at examples of someone who's used the drug for years as a cautionary tail. 
* Most everything that affects your perception or brain chemistry is a drug. Treat it that way. This includes food, cough syrup, coffee and all sorts of other things that our culture doesn't consider to be "drugs."
* The legal and cultural stories about drugs don't always sync up the a drugs real risk. Sugar, caffeine, nicotine and ADHD meds are all evaluated as being less risky than they really are. Psilocybin is evaluated as being much more risky than it really is. There a lots of other examples, but you should decide for yourself instead of just following along with whether something is okay or not.
* Don't take drugs and operate heavy machinery. Don't drink and drive. Don't drink and ride a bike. A corollary, never get high and show someone how high you can jump or how fast you can run. You're asking for an injury.
* If you ever take drugs and need to get home/somewhere safe call me, your mother, your brother, or a friend. Or call a car and charge it to a credit card. It's always worth the money or the bother to have someone else make sure you make it out safely. Related, think about who you'd call in an emergency before you take the drugs, and try to only take drugs in safe spaces (this includes legally safe spaces where you're less likely to break the law or get caught doing it).
* You have an addictive personality. You come by it as a) a human being and b) by family. Take that into account. You're more likely to get addicted to something than your friends. I don't expect you to never try drugs, but if you get addicted you're going to be sorry. Addiction is a beast and it will eat you alive.
* Never show up anywhere important while using drugs. Work. A first impression. A date. 
* Wait until college if you can or until you're 25 when your brain has stopped developing as quickly to avoid mental damage. 
* Learn how to navigate the adult world sober. It's the better way to navigate it. 
* If you're using to comfort yourself or to deal with fear and anxiety talk to a therapist. Otherwise, you're just self-medicating a problem that won't go away. You always need to address the underlying problem.



Consider psychedelics once every twenty years, probably not more frequently.

Develop both hard skills (that are rewarded by the market) and people skills (which will help you everywhere) and you'll have the foundation of a great career. 

Choose the overlap of two different but valuable when combined skills. 
* It's really hard to be the best in the world at something, but it's much easier to be in the top 25% of two different things which are valuable when overlapped. 

Minimum viable audience + famous to the family

There are useful ideas available from every category of knowledge.
* Learn to identify them and then weaving them all together into a mental model of "how the world works" is the work of a generalist. 

There's value in creating to learn, but not everything you create should be published to an audience. 

Reread your favorite books, especially your own marginalia.

Feed yourself inspiration to keep motivated during a big change or when building habits.
* Books on a topic. Movies. Fiction about it. Real-life stories. Biographies. Advice books. Videos of other people doing the thing. Read or watch a little every day. It's more useful to drip it out little by little so that you're consuming some inspiration every day than it is to binge and stop. The little bit you consume will feed your motivation to keep going.

Cognitive biases (judgment and decision making)  
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases

When things fall apart by Pema chodron

Statistics
* The power of stories and images to persuade people is much stronger than statistics or numbers

Symbolic or formal logic

The lean start up
* Minimum viable product
* Build measure learn cycle
* Innovation accounting

Being indispensable to a community is a powerful position to stand in. 
* Either by being the connector who strengthens the bond between the community and brings in new members.
* Or by being the leader who helps point the community at a goal and focus its energy.

The 48 laws of power by Robert Greene

The prince by Machiavelli

The way of the peaceful warrior by Dan Milman

Fahrenheit451 by Ray Bradbury

Asimov quote about your ignorance and my knowledge  

The scientific method: hypothesis, design an experiment, observe/measure, conclusion.  

Is it repeatable/reproducible?

Your mileage may vary — what works for one person doesn’t always work for everyone. If it does it’s probably a foundational law of nature (e.g. gravity, thermodynamics )

The “soft” social sciences are undervalued and that’s a mistake of our scientific culture.  

Clothes that fit (well sized or tailored) make a world of difference. They usually look much better than more expensive, higher quality clothing that’s ill fitting.  

Dress for your body shape.  

Changing your body shape (not easy to do, but possible) can expand the range and styles of clothing available. Especially if you change to a shape that designers design for.  

If you think you’re wearing too many accessories or statement pieces you probably are. Try the mirror test. Stand in front of a full length mirror. Turn your back to it. Face away from it for 60 seconds. Turn towards it and ask “what’s the first thing I noticed myself wearing?” That’s the item that’s too loud. That’s the one to remove or change.  

Oliver Sacks and many designers on the joy of a dress code. Reduce decision fatigue and create a signature look.  

Find examples (heroes) of what you want to look like. Do you have similar body shapes? Facial structure? Hair? If so that’s a good example. Deconstruct what they wear. How they cut their hair. How their look changes over time. Mix and match from your examples to find patterns and strategies. Emulate the patterns and strategies, make them your own. Add your own idiosyncratic touches. Don’t copy any example exactly.  

When designing a product or experience, find heroes and examples. Steal ideas. Deconstruct the patterns and strategies. Compile an anti-pattern list (things not to do). Use these resources to create your thing. This is a much faster and more likely to succeed method than starting from scratch.

Positioning
* When positioning something collect a list of all the competitors. Draw many x/y axis. Write a list of things people value about the thing/person you’re positing. Include in the list things people value generally. Choose two items from the list and put them on the axis. One on x and one on y. Write the opposite of x and y at the other ends. Map out all the competitors on the axis. Look for a gap in the market. Is there an opening where you can go that’s profitable? Can you be faster? More human and helpful? Louder? More minimal? Keep doing this until you find a value that’s valued that you can deliver more of than your competitors. Be honest about whether you have the will or the ability to go to that values edge. Ask whether the your competitor can catch up with you (close that gap). Does this position have a moat around it? Is it defensible? Is there a reason that someone isn’t already there? Is this a position you want to be in? Never race to the bottom. Never compete to be the cheapest—you might win or worse come in second. A race to the bottom is lazy and easy—too many people will race that race against you.

Pluck your eyebrows. Especially if you get my unibrow. Get it waxed or pluck it. Never shave it. 

Always tell a friend if they have food in their teeth. 

A strong, gentle, quick handshake is an important part of a first impression. But it rarely beats a hug if you know and like the person.

Matching colors + dressing
* Match the color of your belt to your shoes (mostly when wearing leather). Also match your watch wristband. But don’t get too uptight if it doesn’t match. It won’t kill you.  
* More importantly think about warm vs cool colors (gold vs  silver) when picking a wedding ring. So you can coordinate other jewelry.  
* Are you a cool color or warm color person? Hair color and skin tone determine this.

Make promises, keep them
* Do what you say you're going to do.

Under-promise, over-deliver.

Treat the root cause, not the symptoms. 

When you read non-fiction, ask yourself what three things you want to learn from the book. Write the Q and your answers in the front of the book. Write what you learn. 

_How to Read a Book_ by Mortimer and Van Doren

_Self-Reliance_ by Ralph Waldo Emerson

Cultivate your own traditions
* Do things each season to help you celebrate and mark the passage of time. 
* Adopt existing traditions that you like and make them your own.
* Related: Have something to look forward to

What am I looking forward to?
* Having something to anticipate fondly is a fun way to create enjoyment in life. 
* It's also a good way to deal with a mind too active. Instead of being anxious about past or present, focus the forward looking mind on something pleasant and constructive.
* Have something small to look forward to soon, and something big to look forward to further off. 

Goals
* Goals are powerful motivators, and markers of progress. 
* For a goal to work it should be S.M.A.R.T.: Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic and Time-bound.
	* No: someday I want to explore the universe
	* Yes: I want to save $XXXX ($XXX a week for X weeks) so I can travel to Mars on August 17th, 2047 for Dad's birthday.
	* PS - It's fine to want big unspecific things, but if you want to make the big unspecific things real or to really get them not just dream about them, then break the big things down into small things, make the unspecific specific, and assign who's responsible for doing which part by when.

"A mind too active is no mind at all." --Roethke

Practice being in the moment. Be here, now.
* Absorbed with the experience of what's happening here and now.  With what you notice and feel. Bring your thoughts (from the past/future) into the present. Focus on your breathing.
* Learn to turn it on/off. Each of the three is a skill, you need all three: 1) Remembering the past. 2) Being present in the moment. 3) Imagining the future.

Be kind. To yourself and others.
* Not one at the expense of the other.
* You don't need to be kind to someone who's proven themselves to be an asshole. 
* Be the first to offer kindness. A lot of people will offer kindness in return, but are too afraid to go first and offer it.

Good sleep hygiene is a keystone habit. 
* Go to bed at the same time every night.
* Wake up at the same time every morning. 
* This includes weekends. You can't really "make up for" sleep and breaking your circadian rhythm does more harm than good. That said, it can feel really nice to sleep in once a month on holidays. 
* Don't use screens in the last hour of the day.
* Stop drinking caffeine eight hours before bed. 
* Stop exercising 2-3 hours before bed. 
* White noise, ear plugs, sleep masks, and blackout curtains help.
* Only use bed for sleep and sex, not as a place to read books or watch TV. If you train yourself to sleep when you're in bed, it will be easier to sleep. 
* If you're having trouble sleeping, you probably need more exercise. 


Choosing a partner is the most important decision you'll make in your life.

Sex, consent, respect, objectification, cultural pressure, societal "norms", advertising, and expectations.

Who takes responsibility? Enrollment trick
via https://www.wired.com/story/universities-public-interest-technology-courses-programs
'This is a powerful field-development trick: Attendees had to write down answers to questions like "How will you develop new resources and mobilize existing funding mechanisms to expand the field?" If the writer didn't want to commit, they could say, "We [the group of attendees] should" do X or Y. And a final option was "someone should" do tasks that seemed beyond the remit of the group in the room.'

... I will do it.
... We should do it.
... Someone should do it.

I think the trick works like this: instead of people rejecting the idea because they're not willing to say I will do it, you get them to support the idea by taking less responsibility (hiding behind We or Someone). Does it let the person off the hook? Yes, probably, but if it's also about generating ideas, letting people off the hook can help them generate new ideas. 

Grocery store test

For people who are trying to make something for everyone.  

Name something in the grocery store that everyone likes.  

It's hard to do. 

... Related: if you’re not being specific enough yet. Pick someone it’s not for and write a list of things you could include that would enrage them.  

These things are the things your audience might love. See if you can take this list and push to the extremes. This is how you make a unique, clearly positioned product


Freelancers vs staff
Staff is in-house. We treat them like family and grow with them. 

Freelancers are external. We have a lot of them and pay extra for the ability to walk away at any time (no second chances). We have a deep bench. We don't do anything we're not proud of but we don't worry about their feelings.



Software project management
1. Know when to give the "whole job" to someone vs. a small "task"
    * see "whole job" vs. "task"
2. The spec has three pieces, know which parts to collaborate on:
    1. ME -- problem to be solved
    2. ME/THEM -- ways to solve it
    3. ME/THEM -- tests/how will we know it's working
3. Limit access to what a vendor can change in the code base
    * if the test is clear (easy to know the fix works) allow access
    * if the test is unclear (hard to know if the fix works) don't allow access
4. Always break the project down into the smallest chunks possible.
    * Even if we're giving someone the whole job review based on a series of small chunks. 
    * Do one chunk at a time. 
    * The chunks can get bigger over time as trust is earned
5. Always get an hourly estimate and concrete deliverable date for each chunk of the gig. Track actual hours against the estimate.
6. Fire someone earlier than I think I should if they're not a good fit.
    * see freelancers vs. staff
7. Have a deep bench of freelancers so I'm not stuck with someone I can't fire or left without a replacement. 
8. Have onboarding docs and FAQ for what it's like to work with us. Have people use those to come up to speed and/or determine it's not a good fit for them to work here. 
9. The first job someone does is always a small non-mission-critical trial.
    * it doesn't have to be a job that's useful to us (it just need to help us evaluate them)
    * see hiring a bench
10. Have a system for gig workflow and run all the projects through it the same way
    * onboarding docs
    * clear specs
    * github
    * slack
    * pivotal tracker


Hiring a bench
Break apart the coding from the communication, problem-solving. This is why large tech cos ask brainteasers. 

We've got a two step hiring process: 
1. the interview (unpaid)
2. a trial gig (paid)

The interview involves answering three complex problems and is designed to evaluate their communication skills. Does this person (potentially on the spectrum) communicate clearly and with respect to someone who knows less than them about their area of expertise? 

We're going to ask you three complex (or simple) problems. We want you to spend no more than a half hour on this. We want you to do it in writing via email.

The trial gig involves a coding gig (which doesn't have to be useful to us), which is easy for us to evaluate. We want them to estimate the job in hours. Give us an hourly rate. Tell us if there's anything they need from us to get it done (purposely leave something out to see if they notice before they get to that step). 

We're looking for:
* how they read a spec and ask questions, notice dependencies
* their ability to estimate the time it will take
    * maybe also track to see how accurate the estimate is
* comment their code
* the readability of their code
* explain their code afterwards

Set a tripwire for the trial gig. Touch base at X (hours/dollars) before moving on.

Run multiple people through the trial gig. Always use the same trial gig. 


How to know when it's "whole job" vs "task"

Whole job is easier, more expensive, only with a trusted partner.
Task requires more communication, coordination, management, but cheaper and gives greater overall control.

Don't give mission critical whole jobs to people. 
Don't give whole jobs unless the spec is exceedingly clear.
Do give whole jobs to people when the job is a known quantity. 
* not the first time someone's done this
* lots of people offer this service
    * ex. WordPress theme

Seth thinks about this in terms of "theory of the firm":
* cost of coordination vs. efficiency of focus
* project risk vs. cost/speed
* test suite / qa

Ways to solve needing help with a project / hiring
Seth mentioned three different approaches to the M/M discussion. 
1. Rolodex
2. Great attitude employee, who's eager to learn
3. Establish pro w/ great attitude

I'm going to with approach #1 and develop a rolodex of great freelancers. Seth is going to help coach me. 

Splitting time between outside freelancers and internal colleagues
Have the discipline to say: 
* Office Hours: Fixed hours each day when I'm going to respond to slack notices, unless you say "code red"
* Manager Hours: A set number of hours each day when I work on moving the projects under my purview forward. 
    * Raise my hand if it's taking 2x-4x longer than I estimated so we can figure out if there's a better way to manage the process or if this just isn't something I understand well enough to manage.

Knowing when to hire myself
When determining who should do the work, ask: 
* How long would it take ___me___ to do this? 
* How long would it take ____known freelancer____ to do this?
* How long would it take ___unknown new freelancer___ to do this? 

It's okay to invest in someone else doing it if:
1. it's to build the rolodex
2. it's faster to teach/manage than do it myself

It's okay to do it myself if: 
1. I don't need to build the rolodex
2. it's faster for me to do it
3. it's an emergency

Ways to hire someone to do a gig for us
Two ways to hire someone: 
1. Spec -- here's what we need done. Do that.
2. Consult -- here's what we need done, how do we write the spec? 

We don't buy hours. We buy results/stuff.

Understanding motivations
These are four common motivators for human behavior.
* culture
* fear 
* shame
* getting ahead
 When someone acts in a way you don’t understand, make an assertion about which of these four things could be the motivator and why. 


Getting to the root of an objection
Don’t engage with the specifics, take the discussion up a level. Ask the obligating question: “if I X could do Y, then would you buy?” Always ask the obligating question before addressing why X can do Y. 



Writing a Project Brief
What is it for? 
What does it remind me of? 
What does it look and feel like? 
Who does what when? 



How to stay light and playful when there’s a lot on my plate
Decide to have a lot on my plate. It’s easier to dance when you’re looking forward to something that you get to do instead of slogging through something that you have to do. 



Ways to cycle faster
* Know if it’s brand marketing or direct marketing
    * if it’s brand marketing start every request and project with a brand brief:
        * it will remind me of this
        * it will do this
        * it won’t do this
        * here’s the budget (heavy + light), time and money
        * here’s the media it will be in
    * if everything in the brand brief is signed off on, then the bias is for action and saying YES when the design work is done
    * if it’s direct marketing put it out there and see what the yield is
* Have 2 crits a week:
    * these are all the things on my plate
    * here’s my roadmap
    * here are my lightweight solutions (with budget estimates)
    * here are my heavy solutions (with budget estimates)


When I have conversations about how to do something or ask for revisions, talk in terms of COST. 
* Yes, I could do that. It would cost X hours, and we’d have to bump X. Is it worth it? 




On waiting to get a call about your calling: 
Another way to think about it: you’re either building an asset or you’re looking for people to tell you what to do. 



Your progress report (blog post)
I'm not sure we need to see a checklist of what you got done last week. What we really need:

1. the difficult questions that remain unanswered
2. the long-term goals where you don’t feel like progress is being made
3. risky, generous acts that worked

Even more important: All the things that aren't on your list, but could be.


Dreams and Fears. Sooner or later, important action taken comes down to this. Marketers put many layers atop these basic needs (horsepower, processor speed, features, pricing, testimonials, guarantees, and more) but it all comes down to dreams and fears.
* Fear: Of being ashamed, feeling stupid, being rejected, being left out, getting hurt, being embarrased, left alone, dying.

* Dreams: Of being seen, being needed, becoming independent, relieving anxiety, becoming powerful, making someone proud, fitting in, seen as special, mattering, taken care of, loved.

This is how we make change. By caring enough to want to change a culture, and being brave enough to pick just one. When we’re comfortable realizing that our work is to change ‘a culture’, then we can begin to do two bits of hard work:
* Map and understand the worldview of a culture we seek to change.
* Focus all our energy on merely this group. Ignore everyone. Instead, focus on building and living a story that will resonate with the culture you are seeking to change.


Three steps to making a choice (because choice is rarely rational)
1. What does this remind me of?
2. Does this offer ring a bell?
3. Do people like me do something like this?


Am I letting people off the hook or putting them on the hook?
* OFF the hook
    * I’ve given their fear a reason to say “no” not now, it’s not for me.
* ON the hook
    * I’ve called their bluff and created a new fear of missing out and being left out. I’m using FOMO and peer pressure to make it more likely they’ll do something.
* Example:
    * If you’re deciding to go to the Galapagos Islands. Watching a movie lets you off the hook because you think you’ve seen it now and/or you saw something about it that you don’t like and you’re glad you didn’t go. Having a conversation with your sister who says “you have to go, it’s the most amazing thing ever, you’ve got to experience it for yourself” puts you on the hook because there is no substitute and someone you know is pressuring you to do it. Now you worry you’re really missing out.
* I’m about 50% at understanding how this works, but the nuances are still cloudy.

Things people will think about something you’re selling them:
* What do I tell my friends?
* I’ll do it later
* Is this for me?
* Am I a good fit for it?

Consider when designing a website?
* What does the visitor see before clicking through the first time?
* What do they see before they click the second time?
    * Focus on the experience of these initial encounters and consider what will get them to click.
